I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well'"

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Components design , um  uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh  elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um  you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .  I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the  because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control'",
        "'Marketing': 'Drop it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to  it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material . Um  I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .'",

        "'Marketing': 'You have to go t'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Let's make it uh black . Okay . I thought of an idea like this . Oh  that .  Um delete . Blank . Okay . So it also looks nice when it's on your table .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'but .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some  or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .'",
        "'Marketing': 'True .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh  the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions ,  ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . '",

        "'Project Manager': 'It must be recognisable .'",

        "'User Interface': 'You can put the R_ and R_ . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We could make a little R_ and R_  on the top of the machine . Uh so they are  pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh  them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .

Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you .

The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff .Kay . The method I used was  Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's  quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .'",

        "'User Interface': ' Let's build it into a sponge .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges . And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh y '",
        "'Marketing': 'this or something . It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something .'",

        "'User Interface': 'It was one remote , I think ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Different colours , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'different colours .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a  . '",
        "'User Interface': ' wait , like  like this  uh a bit .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'I know what you mean .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Same sides .  But that's uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's also easy to to have  to to put in your hand .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh  But perhaps that's a good thing ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh new , blank . So uh when you get  this uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Ooh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh kinda like this .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Or should it be larger ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Larger I think .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Larger ? Because you want to put your hands '",
        "'User Interface': 'But if you pu'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . '",
