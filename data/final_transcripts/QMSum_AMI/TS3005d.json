        "'Project Manager': 'Otherwise we have two results in one question .'",
        "'User Interface': ' It's different .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , next question .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .'",
        "'User Interface': 'For young people I think it's easy to use .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Young means sixteen to forty years .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , I was  uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And elderly from forty eight to their death .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think it's '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . '",
        "'User Interface': ' In the entire mankind .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Also if you're sixty years old '",
        "'Project Manager': 'huh ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to '",
        "'Marketing': 'Also'",
        "'Project Manager': 'As well for the for the older people ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh sure .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , as well as your  if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but uh  Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , okay ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'so it it it has to be '",
        "'User Interface': 'but so they could  Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because that might '",
        "'Marketing': ' If you read the manual ,'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah , alright . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Perhaps that is one of the most uh '",
        "'Marketing': ' always .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh because a lot of  '",
        "'User Interface': 'You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Channel one , channel four , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . I think it would make it uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , I think it does .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because all the people who can't uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'I would make it two .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Also two ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh a two . Sure , two .'",

        "'Marketing': 'No ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , uh'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'the remote score .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'A false , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's not overwhelmed . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , indeed .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'is optional .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's true .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Nee we we also want to make ano another colour .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I  then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Half ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I think you pay half per remote .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'So each remote with a special colour .'",
        "'User Interface': 'and you  one colour per remote .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , indeed , yeah .'",
