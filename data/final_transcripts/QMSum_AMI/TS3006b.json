Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls .  Users think they're ugly . Um  they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um  they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ .  I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Ts'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'No .  Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'N not used anymore .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh below I believe .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The new product ? Or below '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah below forty .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um  Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's  so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um  And I think  and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control  in your room .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's  the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah so the the logo has to be'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Present and the colours .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Do we have  uh yeah  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Kay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah frequency . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah decoder .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . This would be uh '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay the  yeah . That's possible .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean if you grab it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , okay . Okay we put it on top .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe on the top or even on the side .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'True .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think that top is the best option .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I dunno . Should be able to work .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .  .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Never mind . Can we leave this up to you ? '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So  but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Volume . Up . Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Screen is over there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . If we '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah . That's uh that's a good one .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': ' Like uh bass uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Sound ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so we need kind of an equaliser . If you '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah it it's just a remote control so '",
        "'Project Manager': 'and they're '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'They're not used often so '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
