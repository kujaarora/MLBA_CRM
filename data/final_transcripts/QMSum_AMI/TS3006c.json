        "'Marketing': ' Spicy .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Spicy .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Where are are all the other presentations ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be '",
        "'Marketing': 'The conceptual or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . What or whatever does it '",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah . Because I see only my own presentation  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No no no , can you go back one ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uhcause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'This ?  I'll just put it in there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So , he's coming .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' .  I did get a bit more done than the last time ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Or not .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the '",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah . She  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'You can look at the final report ,cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Move to meeting room .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and also with  I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah me too ,  .'",
        "'User Interface': ' I I've got the same problem as well . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh  f the remote control has to support .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Thi'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So who wants go .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Who wants to start ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Me first again or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah sure . Doesn't matter .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh . No . Yeah . No problem'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or '",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'Marketing': 'no . Ah . Ah . Yes . So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching .  Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them '",
        "'Marketing': 'oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . Um well the developments ? Uh development one .  Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Sound . Yeah yeah uh uh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so I don't expect that to be a problem . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um  Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So um that kind of gets you this ratios . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That this will be a crux . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And shall I go first ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So I '",
        "'User Interface': 'That's '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah yeah sure . No .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So kind of this '",
        "'User Interface': 'Do you want to go first ? Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' So a k a small example .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Kind of this this look .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I dunno .  Just made a quick design .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Cool .  Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's better than than my uh drawing . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah okay but I have to design the '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh components .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah layout .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh no .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . It's okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You probably opened it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah true . Um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'F_ five .'",
        "'Marketing': 'F_ five .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can  and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . There is a lot of um  factors involved in choosing the components .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Wi an indoors .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So uh my '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Calculator's can do it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that's not cool either . So um  for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um  I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curvedcause it's daring and different from what we have now . Uh the case materials .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubbercause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that's not really interesting .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Electronics ? Yeah ,  maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use  the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production ,cause they they can print it better . Um  Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery ,cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'where you have to move the thing to be able to use it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'As an optional uh feature .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Or combine uh both with a with one uh'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah maybe we '",
        "'Marketing': 'I guess we can only choose one .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . And it's more fun .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I didn't receive any info uh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And it's also more fun yeah . I always chuck my uh remote control around , so '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , just playing with it'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and  especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'S yeah it's safe .'",
        "'User Interface': ' And throw it  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah y exactly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'so it's a perfect combination I guess .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that's the end of it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So '",
        "'Project Manager': ''Kay next .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh go ahead .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So double curved is like this , this , this , or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Also in in height ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Can we uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . So um   Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well the visual representation is not there with speech'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Design ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and '",
        "'Project Manager': 'but you can  Yeah . Just  yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So I don't think you have to design anything else for that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah with the programme .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Both .'",
        "'User Interface': 'For for everything ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'also for the advanced options ? Okay . Uh we have this  very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh  yeah um  Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your  yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': '  you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That would be the back .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I'm  The back .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Back and okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Back and okay yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Back and okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You did read the minutes I wrote ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'You did read the minutes I wrote ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh okaycause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So '",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Oh  I uh didn't read that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I hate doing work for nothing . '",
        "'User Interface': 'But   But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous  so that's an a also an option . Um that was it .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' That was it ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Uh   again . Ugh .  Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh the case would be doubly curved . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And rubber . Rubber material .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Rubber material .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh okay . No it's easy . '",
        "'Marketing': 'So that's uh  is that is that the advanced chip ? '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Advanced chip . Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Wow . Yeah . Alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Kinetic . Double curved .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Too  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'to be able to m'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh I didn't get any info on this . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Socause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's gonna be difficult huh ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I have total here .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah I don't know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah yeah yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I didn't get any information about that so '",
        "'User Interface': ' . We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Child labour man , we love it .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , so it's cheap .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um well the interface type supplements .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah the interface , maybe can '",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh  yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ooh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um let me see . Wait a sec .'",
        "'Marketing': 'If you go to your homepage or something , you should'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I'm going there now .'",
        "'Marketing': 'get your own information .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Inspiration .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Ah you didn't draw it yourself .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well '",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Ah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Too less time .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um  yeah maybe it's '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , also the menu .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah that that w'",
        "'User Interface': 'This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe it's easier '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Arrow .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Arrow yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Yeah perfect .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So '",
        "'Project Manager': ' .S the target group .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here .'",
        "'User Interface': 'S yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah sure . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh okay . I see .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Not only like this but it has to be '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah also like this . So you can hold it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'exactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And '",
        "'User Interface': 'But it has also to  it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It ha'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The children's story . Yeah I've got it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Distinction . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'The colour  Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with  LEDs uh beneath the the buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you know , with the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe we should consider this function .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'To customise it and so  I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah yeah bright colours .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And this is , this is with the curved that I mean .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's singly curved .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'A compromise between what ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So s'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This , this would be uh single curved uh ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Also .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .  Exactly . Exactly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think the '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'I would go for the double curved .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it kind of holds nicely , something like that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well this is really your decision but '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Something to shoot at your television  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That's  yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That would be a nice way to use it but  I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that  that you can able to use in one hand I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Different . Stands out . Or  Oh yeah a one hand uh solution .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' can turn it maybe .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have '",
        "'Project Manager': 'To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little .  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'How about '",
        "'Marketing': 'Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh . Something like that . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I understand what you mean .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's uh that's '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'If you can uh flip .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then if you want '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh so you have a the the side view .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Something like that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So and you want to be able to'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean maybe it's too much '",
        "'Project Manager': 'make this'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No uh like '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I would draw it like this . Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that it would come up like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah or  preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh the advanced buttons . Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'That's  the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But you you want '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'F for the L_C_D_ menu right ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'okay . You just want to hide them all ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So w w'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'The  oh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But you can hide the okay and the back uh button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And the menu button also because when you flip it open '",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Activate and th the  yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So  okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Why ? You could just make it mechanical .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'True . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh  with a '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .  Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your '",
        "'User Interface': 'That's  but it's it's not'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Exactly .'",
        "'User Interface': 'it's not very uh very strong uh  yeah if you drop it one time  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'True . It uh c it can go open .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'If you cover it with rubber . Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': 'An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . So it can bounce .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly . Exactly . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , uh  It's very no it's very strong .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What kind of '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Harder .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . With your uh wrist .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f'",
        "'User Interface': 'But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh yeah . Yeah of course .'",

        "'Project Manager': ' It's difficult .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And if the background is very dark blue '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Blue . Maybe green .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ?'",
