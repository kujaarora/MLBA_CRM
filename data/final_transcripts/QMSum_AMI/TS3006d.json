We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?'",

        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'How about  Sorry .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .'",

        "'Marketing': ' we  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh yeah . We do .'",

        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' You were saying something .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But um  Now let's look .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah we c could  We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So  With the display .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The joystick .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Kind of . I was  Because '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . If you if you go to '",
        "'Marketing': 'Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If you go to our uh view , like you  if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But you still  But you then still need to have  Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah it's r Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And then just drop all the other buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well not all .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Not s not sound I guess .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . It's uh  One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So '",
        "'User Interface': 'So we have to to make it s uh more uh  It has to be '",
        "'Project Manager': 'You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh , that's for the speech .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Speech recognition .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Could drop the speech recognition . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'S s Drop speech recognition ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' No but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah that's possible . '",
        "'User Interface': 'We we d'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition .Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's not very easy to use .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , it can be disturbed by by noise and'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .'",
        "'Marketing': 'stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I have to look on that . Let me see .  Uh well no I was wrong .'",
        "'Marketing': 'There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we  need a lot of '",
        "'Marketing': 'But if it   But it it  it's a it's a both a hypers'",
        "'User Interface': 'We lose our whole concept .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh so  No we just '",
        "'Project Manager': 'We need a lot of extra buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , but '",
        "'User Interface': 'We keep the L_C_D_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We uh we we haven't really integrated this  the speech into the system ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'so we drop the speech .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so we can might as well s drop that . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And drop it yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Let's drop the speech .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sixteen Euros .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' We need to lose some buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But y y'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button  Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then you're '",
        "'Marketing': 'And then and then use um '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Oh and the power button we have also .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The the  Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then when you in the menu '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So that's one Euro .'",
        "'Marketing': 'S so so you activate the menu .'",
        "'User Interface': 'If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah . Yeah ? And  '",
        "'User Interface': 'With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah yeah .  Yeah .  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That would save zero point two Euros compared to  No .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No it's three Euros . No ? Um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . To This together is more expensive than  Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No it's it's n Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And we can drop these two .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's the '",
        "'Marketing': 'For example if you have f f four buttons ,  channel up and down , uh volume left right '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Volume .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Okay , I've  I think we have to keep that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And the power button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then  and the power button . So that's five .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's the basic .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a  you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep . Okay th that's '",
        "'Marketing': 'But we can't drop three buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Which   That's even '",
        "'Marketing': 'But I see that's '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah that's one Euro more expensive .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So    that's not a good idea .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's not an option .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Menu , power .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . F of the four things ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Four arrows ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , th power .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Power . Uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah , if you if you go to eight '",
        "'Marketing': ' Which more ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I don't know how to '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh power I believe ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Power . Th Yeah that's five .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh  We have a Back and a Okay button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , okay that's seven ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And the Menu .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So '",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh , well okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'The L_C_D_ ? Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Let's make the  Let's make the case plastic .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah well we need the advanced '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then I rather make it wood .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Instead of r'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . True .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah but but that's not our market .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But '",
        "'Project Manager': 'No that  maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Ah no , hard plastic . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Plastic with a with a special colour .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Oh .'",
        "'User Interface': 'A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , plastic with special colour .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ? '",
        "'Marketing': ' No but I I '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah okay uh '",
        "'User Interface': ' That's an option . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep . Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So we do one one s'",
        "'Marketing': ' So let's go for the plastic .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , okay . Plastic .'",
        "'Marketing': 'And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh that's easy because plastic is free . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We still have problem of two Euros .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'No the buttons , those are really needed .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah th th it's it's uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah we can't drop them .'",
        "'User Interface': 'An advanced chip-on-print . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' You still need that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah uh '",
        "'Marketing': ' Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You  uh uh  Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and  Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' S'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That doesn't matter .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So the only option is an hand dynamo .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Oh that '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah and something else .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah but the '",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ?Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w'",
        "'Marketing': 'And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No y you would rec'",
        "'Marketing': 'I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then you have '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then you still need two additional buttons I believe .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'For the volume .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You can use those  Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Three . Up , down , Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You can go into you in you main menu ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'You you press it for like three seconds .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , okay . It would save enough '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Maybe we should .Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' So we can maybe still use power button .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , but we'd   Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I guess we have to .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . You see ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We'll we'll be on '",
        "'Marketing': 'But we still have thirteen left .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh still  Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Thirteen . So still half . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Shit . Drop the special colour . '",
        "'Marketing': 'There goes the special co '",
        "'User Interface': ' Oh no .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'No no , it has to be um curved .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah it says right here .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' They made it very easy for us . '",

        "'Marketing': 'Well yeah .   yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than  '",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay . Wh what we could do is um  drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Buttons . That's  Oh yeah since we only have one button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
