It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh  a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um  Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's  it is uh  can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh   it's all very uh '",

Uh  Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy  the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um  uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that was it .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . It's alright . Um  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um  yes . The working method um  there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um ,  three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results .  Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,  relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got  we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um  an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So ,  what I was thinking  oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh  there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh  yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': ' And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh   Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Visually presents .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh  consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , then we  I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh , well some of the uh new requirements  make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because um uh s decided to put  They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Two ? '",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's impossible , I think .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No way .'",
        "'Marketing': ' No uh , I agree , I agree .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special  put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or '",
        "'Marketing': 'Not too much , no .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger '",
        "'Marketing': ' I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but it is  it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mayb yeah ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want ,  you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh '",
        "'Marketing': ' Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well I think , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's '",
        "'Marketing': 'Not too much then , bu alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay ,  something else nice to know .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But what's our slogan ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Sorry ? Yeah ,  you will have to look that up . '",
        "'User Interface': 'The slogan uh  '",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , I'll have a look .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' I think it's something about the '",
        "'User Interface': 'Puts fashion in electronics . '",
        "'Marketing': 'We put the fashion in electronics .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh , okay .  I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but '",
        "'User Interface': ' Sense simplicity . '",
        "'Marketing': ' Sense and simplicity . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay well ,  let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to  the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the  maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh  yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think we can implement more functions then , because um  basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but wha'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and therefore will be a more '",

        "'User Interface': 'But '",
        "'Project Manager': 'because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well , ma'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So why should j we put this function in ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' Well , I think '",
        "'User Interface': 'I think more  I think uh people  younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But I think uh you  we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have  Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yes .'",

        "'User Interface': 'It's n Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other  maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'But you can put them under the same button .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Not much more than that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , if  as far as possible .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep . Or we can u u we could putem behind the flip-flap or whatever .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But what do you think ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'So t'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that  to control other devices ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , you don't think so ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'No , new requirements say no .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Well , maybe it's '",

        "'Project Manager': 'maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with '",

        "'Marketing': 'Y yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yep , exactly . That's that's wha'",
        "'Marketing': 'But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No no , you don't   No no , you don't need it . No , no .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'so um but uh from my experience it's kinda  a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm , yeah .'",

        "'Marketing': ' Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but just   keep it simple and look more at th'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh  dozens of of remote controls that have '",
