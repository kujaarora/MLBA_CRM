We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of  in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh  yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .'",

Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm  It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled  a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to  uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy .

Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um  Uh here you have to have a hand uh  yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and  so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .'",

Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays .
