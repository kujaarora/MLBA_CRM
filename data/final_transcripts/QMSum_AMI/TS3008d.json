        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , but'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , well  but su  If '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'some televisions don't accept uh that that '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , no , but s'",
        "'Marketing': 'No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yes . Yes , that's true .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . True .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think it works that way , really .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , but it's exact the same  that w would appear when you put a separate button  push a separate button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point .'",

That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in  on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you  the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But you give the input .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so they need  no , they need '",

        "'Marketing': 'No , that's not true .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'yes it it is .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's simply not true . It's simply not true .'",

        "'User Interface': 'You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's  I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , it '",
        "'Project Manager': 'But okay , we we'll impl'",

        "'User Interface': 'We'll discuss them in the usability lab .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , we'll apply them then for now .'",

        "'User Interface': 'I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether  '",
        "'User Interface': ' Okay .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but I still think i it it  all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't  uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , no .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Th won't work wi with uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'to have that special button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . But '",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes . It's here on the  '",
        "'User Interface': ' Well it '",
        "'User Interface': 'yeah , uh there's nothing  I think it's pretty basic ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We came uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'the the  there's no fu'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'there's one there's one button ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'No nothing really trendy about it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'The button .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because Real  Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'uh hearing devices .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh  when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh '",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah , of course . Mm-hmm . Well it it got it  it has got to fit into the shape , of course .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , but we can make '",
        "'Marketing': 'The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's true , but uh '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , when you make it large enough no it it will not .'",
        "'Marketing': 'yeah , I think '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But then it's a little bit '",
        "'Marketing': 'No , but if if  like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But it's just an idea .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You can . But i i i it's backwards .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can  '",

        "'User Interface': 'But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh  from the bottom '",
        "'User Interface': 'That's text . '",
        "'Marketing': 'oh , right , help .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But '",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes , little holer  littler  Uh , little products go deeper in it .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . That i that is possible , yep .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes . And uh uh'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But we have to look n I don't know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I don't like the colours . Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So it's it's it's really good design .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . That's it ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , but in the  oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yes .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And and less buttons than this isn't possible .'",

        "'Marketing': 'No , really .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible . Yeah , we could skip the numbers .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but but '",

        "'User Interface': 'That's still four .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but but it isn't fo Yes , it's for  it's li uh it's just for a little '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that's no option , that's no option .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay , we'll we'll just  okay . But then still ,  when we  there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh  oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it  this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .'",
        "'User Interface': ' A special colour , why a special colour ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Otherwise , it '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , special material r also ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Is it ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Plastic .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Kay , but the problem now is that  the  There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Separately .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Se no no no .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'yes . And and  but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of  can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , yeah . Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we  yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It uh  but it  then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can '",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , but you  otherwise you can't retrieve it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'but then you still have to use  we have to find out what chip we u need .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked .Cause I think we uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yep .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'oh , it's gonna get more expensive with  . Two .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Then we have some money left . We can put then '",

        "'Project Manager': 'We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Uh why ?'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know  then we exactly know what it will cost us .'",
        "'User Interface': 'If if i'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe is that  that's nice to know .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Regular chip and  because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , bu bu but when we  yeah , but when we skip when we um  when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still  yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I like the hand dynamo part .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still  maybe we have to use the advanced chip ,'",
