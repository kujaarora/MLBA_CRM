Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .  Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target  audience or our target product users , customers . Well ,  um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .  Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh  seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .'",

Uh  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But  Yeah . That's very important . And '",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But is that is that useable ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well '",
        "'Marketing': 'It's a f it's a new feature ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well it it's '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah alright , but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well also i if someone puts  picks up his uh remote '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it  , I think .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Eighty per cent would .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well ,  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , he feels it immediately .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's very irritating , I think .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah that's true .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's right . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Right , continue .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Sorry . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty  basically uh as you said .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' That's your part of the job . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So yeah  exactly  this is uh how it uh looks from the inside .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yep .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new '",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But I had too too little time ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but uh don't uh don't look at it please .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well we understand .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I I think it's it's clear uh how it works .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We understand .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , it's clear .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh right , no .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright . That's the most important thing .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Nice . Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright . Uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'How late is did we start his presentation uh ? '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right .'",
        "'Marketing': ' I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Wha Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Losing time losing time . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well then we have still the time , so   But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right . So '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well I thought um everybody on the website  uh would see the same thing , but obviously  that's not the case .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I don't think so .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , uh there are different uh  We have all have different home pages , with different links .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'For instance you couldn't see this . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Okay , yeah well .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  Yeah . Well I'm Mike  , User Interface Designer .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'The the method ? Well  I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'These are already in use ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright , okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'Well '",
        "'Project Manager': 'I like user-centred .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , me too .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I like user-centr centred uh  uh also the best .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah . We also do that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'But  Yes .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , right .'",
        "'User Interface': ' I um I kinda like the shape .  I think this is what we talked about . But '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' You can't really see uh the differ from different sides .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But I think uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'No I've  Well I showed it somewhere . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh you can draw it if you  Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So we can can uh yeah customise the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh make someone w'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm ?  Yeah .  It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You can '",
        "'Marketing': 'But it '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's right'",
        "'User Interface': 'Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's a must .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So l like Ericsson does  every uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , we must .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We can put it on the on the back side .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We must have that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah well and and '",
        "'User Interface': 'S something like this . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's recognisable .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Kay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um '",
        "'Marketing': 'We can make a symbol of the company right here . And  if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah yeah yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah . Something like that ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .'",
        "'User Interface': 'in the  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah . Yeah , yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Those kind of things .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But let's not focus on the front  . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um  Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more .  The less buttons the better the design . Um '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'We should go with that concept I think .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I agree .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I know .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'I've I've got another point .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The younger uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'So  The younger audience .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well what if we um  I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'a f a little uh  You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh  uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Clip aren't used much .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No um mm usually '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But '",
        "'Project Manager': 'but not '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah I think  m most '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah but  Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'But I've '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Most uh  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm . Uh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Competitors . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The concurrent ?  Competitors , right .'",
        "'Marketing': ' So , I do think we have to uh have some features .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s'",
        "'Marketing': 'Even though they cost a little more .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right . Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Like a ticker-tape .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Which programme you are l watching or something .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , that's nice . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , right . Yeah right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , we should keep that simple too .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'It will  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well maybe .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No not clickable .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No , it should be uh integrated .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'or  or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Nah , no no no .'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think  '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s  you sit like this you can can watch .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think it should be at the top .'",
        "'User Interface': 'something like on um some radios in car . You  Where it's , yeah , walking to  Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'R_D_S_s or something .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and  that kind of thing .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Wa Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well I think it's you got  It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Well it's just one script . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'and it's not uh  That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'So I don't think that's the issue .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh well I think so , yes . Um '",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .'",
        "'Marketing': ''Kay . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but '",
        "'Project Manager': 'We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Or maybe you will get that information uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Um we can use this board again , I think .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Next time . Yeah right .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue .  Where is my presentation ?  Uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I understand what you're saying .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well  I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right . At the top .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'User Interface': 'At the top or at the bottom ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The L_C_D_ screen alright  but we should start with the power button ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'I think the top is more uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but '",
        "'Marketing': 'When you s How do you zap ?'",
        "'Marketing': 'You just sit in your chair ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Huh ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .'",
        "'Marketing': 'With the remote ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That thing is terrible .'",
        "'User Interface': ''Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , no Mm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I dunno .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here .  I dunno what uh you were talking about but '",
        "'Marketing': 'No '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' we are busy with something  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Um he thinks  Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .'",
        "'Marketing': 'But your '",
        "'User Interface': 'I c'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well I d I think that's that's ugly but '",
        "'Marketing': 'The the ticker  The L_C_D_ is like like small .  It's it's wide .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh-huh .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It's not not high . But  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point ,'",
        "'User Interface': ' I th'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And and we can  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Power button always  Yeah . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Bottom .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So and and I I like to use the ones on the top .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or  you want to  Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window '",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right . But  We're making a remote with  with a few functions you know .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well  that's  a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you  . It's it's also more recognisable .'",
        "'Marketing': 'We'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes but we we we we don't want that .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah you don't want '",
        "'Project Manager': 'We don't want them to look like a calculator .'",
        "'User Interface': 'You want uh  Yeah it it it must be a remote .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We want to look it like our original but familiar '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah w well ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe  important aspect like familiarity uh completely away ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'High-tech  . '",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yea'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'uh because  I think it's uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh   We White ? '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think it's still important to have it at the top ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Width .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because it's uh it's more familiar that way .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Th that's not a problem .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Marketing': ' When I draw here it'",
        "'Marketing': ' Oh . Huh ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's a bit off .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , it's off .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' A little a little bit .'",
        "'Marketing': ' It  it needs to be calibrated again . Well  '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Maybe you should another pen .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe that's uh better .  You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Where ?'",
