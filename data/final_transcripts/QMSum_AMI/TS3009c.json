        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , we should change that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well maybe it it it is ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We should move to uh something '",
        "'Project Manager': 'but it doesn't look strong . So maybe '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So '",
        "'Marketing': 'No no no .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Also  Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Then I've uh  had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'That's nice . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'All the  results ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well I also have um several examples of uh styles ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'We keep coming back to the fronts . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh  these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .  Nai . Uh no .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but that's n that's not what we want .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Fruity .  Fruity .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It looks like  Well you know uh you recognise the shapes ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You also uh  see uh this device , it's not very round and  Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'It's t terrible .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's true .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh well round shapes , primary colours .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'I think as you know something uh some devices like this .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So to give you an idea of uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , it still has a strong look .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah . And it's round .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'But then you are losing your fruity colours .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . Well we have to make a '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .'",
        "'Marketing': 'That's true .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'No , it isn't .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but  But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ''Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah but the '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but '",
        "'Marketing': 'But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The feel ? Uh alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'The feel .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So , if you ti'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well '",
        "'User Interface': 'And it it doesn't have to be strong , also .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well '",
        "'Marketing': 'Nah yeah the feel '",
        "'Project Manager': 'You you  Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Only the feel . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oh .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And I  Then I have some more findings . Um  uh about the energy energy source of the of the device ,'",
        "'Marketing': 'I agree .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh  That's a bit uh much .'",
        "'Project Manager': '  No titanium . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'What do you exactly mean with double curved ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh  now the the shape , yeah ,  a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh  a more modern look not plain , long box style , but '",
        "'Marketing': ' I dunno .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Double curved ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' I'll draw it ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'It it mean '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , well okay . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but maybe later .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh  . Um anyway '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um  uh speak uh speech uh controlled  device .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But  It's worth the trouble I think ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well '",
        "'User Interface': 'The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'because '",
        "'User Interface': 'Because people like that .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'This soft material thing from uh  Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Right . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh soft enough .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . Right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems ,  um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Oh  That's interesting .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Oh okay . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Right .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No it doesn't does not do anything .'",
        "'Marketing': 'No .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh . That's a bit uh '",
        "'User Interface': 'But i it's just a '",
        "'Marketing': 'But that that makes it cheap .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes . I understand .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah it's it's cheap .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . '",
        "'Marketing': 'It's  it's just a an extra function ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But  it has no functionality for our remote at all .'",
        "'Marketing': 'and it's cheap .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No'",
        "'Marketing': 'No but  '",
        "'User Interface': 'but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , right . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But it it's n nice for young people .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Young people love them .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'They like gadgets . Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , ple Right .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'If it's cheap . Yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and  uh and that kind of stuff '",
        "'User Interface': 'um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do .'",
        "'Marketing': ' Alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Can you draw it now of uh '",
        "'Marketing': 'How  How '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Ah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Hmm ? Well I have the  I can draw it again ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Can you draw it now ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the  . Um '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm . Alright .'",
        "'Marketing': 'How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?'",
        "'User Interface': ' Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the '",
        "'Marketing': 'Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah right .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' button , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Just uh   There is already a blank . Yes ? So  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm so have I .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Nah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yellow and  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . '",
        "'User Interface': 'Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah just uh the numbers . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'These these will be bigger in the the real design .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright , yeah .'",
        "'User Interface': 'This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus'",
