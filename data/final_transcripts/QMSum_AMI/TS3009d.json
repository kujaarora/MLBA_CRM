        "'Project Manager': 'So the you're uh  .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Mm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it .'",
        "'User Interface': ' Bit late . '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Alright .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh  I'll show you the notes .  I don't think it's very interesting . '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Oh nei . Uh no .  Alright . This is copy paste . So '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'From me of course , yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Of course . You had some very strange layout .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Okay .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Correct . '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Right . Uh well this is our design .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um  which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours .  Um then we have uh the lower part  of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'It's a double R_ .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo '",
        "'User Interface': 'But  it's very difficult to to draw that in  Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay . Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round  I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Oval yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Alright .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So  uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m'",
        "'User Interface': 'Channel up and volume ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh  uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'And the video button . The '",
        "'Project Manager': 'So '",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm right .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .'",
        "'Project Manager': ''Kay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well if I look at it , the side the side view '",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , at the back  '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'and then you can add suggestions .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Oh yeah alright . Yeah  .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe I I don't want to   I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Yeah the back . Yeah .  We thought about  Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium .  And we thought about the logo big in the middle .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Maybe that's too much'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .'",
        "'User Interface': 'No I don't think  And the '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'User Interface': 'but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well I see , but '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well . Yeah I see it .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yes .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , it won't be visible . Mm ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Why ?  Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , '",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'mean uh the the the the '",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I agree .'",
        "'User Interface': ' If y  If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': ' In the middle in the '",
        "'User Interface': 'You you have it a bit uh  Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'And how large is it ?'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , that's the question .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'That's the question .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh well  Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ?  This was Mike's prototype ,'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well uh '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh  ?'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But now you have a totally different  .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Well , they lay there all the time .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean '",
        "'Project Manager': 'They the the the the the side view ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Side ? Uh oh the side ?'",
        "'Project Manager': 'we didn't uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'W we we he drew the s the side ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'Yeah yeah .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'but you d you weren't paying attention as usual .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea  .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah .'",
