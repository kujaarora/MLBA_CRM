Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after  over this later .

Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it .

        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's  why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .'",

        "'User Interface': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .'",
        "'Project Manager': ' Yeah , okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'So we have to  make something that's not too difficult in design again .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'So you have '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh  uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um  uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Mm-hmm .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'so   Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we  let's see we  So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some  you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase ,'",

        "'Project Manager': 'and I'm  total T_V_ new , anyway . So I think it should be  have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second  second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stickem under a menu , like you said the um  the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stickem under one menu and uh give it a  just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons .'",
        "'User Interface': 'because '",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'um and  Yeah , we have to  either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .'",

        "'Marketing': 'Yeah .'",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but why'",

        "'Project Manager': 'I  I'm not sure .'",
        "'User Interface': 'Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it ,'",

        "'User Interface': 'I'm still not convinced of the '",

        "'User Interface': 'Yeah .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'Well if it if it's'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Hmm .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it ,'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'They want it uh .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': ' We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Huh . Uh . But uh '",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . So I have to look if that's possible .'",
        "'Marketing': 'Yeah , I know uh .'",
        "'User Interface': 'So basically'",

        "'User Interface': 'Well , that would make them quite small .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'We're not sure about the size anyway ,'",
        "'User Interface': 'So maybe you'd put them here .'",
        "'Project Manager': 'just a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh '",

        "'Project Manager': 'Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'But it has to be a little bit heavier .'",

        "'Industrial Designer': 'Okay .'",
        "'Industrial Designer': 'No , but the things behind it .  space .'",
