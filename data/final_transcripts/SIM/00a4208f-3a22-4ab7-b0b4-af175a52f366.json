        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i don't think that unpaid internships should be legal because one they're usually geared towards students fresh out of school and they're already facing debt and different kind of financial struggles so i don't see a benefit on not paying them for their time as if they're working their job and and not paying them it it just doesn't seem beneficial to me in that standpoint'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the but with an unpaid internship you have the chance to to to have something part of your education that you don't have to pay for so why shouldn't that be legal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's true also you don't you already spend your time in the university and what what is the difference if you spend that time in the internship'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just feel like companies have the money to pay their employers and they they definitely have enough money to pay interns if they're doing the work they should definitely be able to i mean i'm not saying that they should receive the exact same pay as if they were an actual employee but some kind of stipend should be given to intern because i mean they are showing up and doing their job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but they are going to gain an experience from this so that when they graduate they can find the israeli jobs because they already have experiences'",

        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sandy would would you like to add something'",

        "'speaker_1': 'road'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a problem which means'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and background and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yeah hispanics or or black people not all black people but a lot of it is that's not my opinion it's just mentioned if you if you if you read the articles about these these this topic is it is it is proven proven that you create problems here and it is also it is also a fact that people which joined an unpaid internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bro'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'does not have more job offers after this unpaid internship then people with didn't join such an internship so you actually don't create an advantage for you if you join an unpaid internship that's just one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i like i like that you're bringing up the statistics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah as always you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'actually i'm kinda disagree with what you're saying in the last sentence because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh for example if for based on my personal experiences'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i did a lot of volunteer internships and this helped me a lot to get uh my my to get my master studies and the others internships as well because they see that you are experiencing you are willing to do something and they see your enthusiasm about it so they rate you a different way so they accept you everywhere so i think it's more high likely to get a job after your volunteered in internships'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i understand that the thing with schooling and it being similar to going to school the difference with that is a some some students still have to go to work during while they're taking classes so if they're working a nine to five internship when does that leave them time to bring in money for for their self when does that leave them time to provide an opportunity to work to actually make that money while they're doing that nine to five'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah so U M U M so since we're we've been looking at the uh intern side uh let's look at the employer side like let's say you're a startup and you're struggling to even stay afloat and now basically your your well you're letting someone work for you who has little to no experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'might need some further'",
        "'speaker_1': 'education so as a start up essentially'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you run the risk of having to educate someone more than let's say someone who's already qualified for the job and on top of that you need to pay them and if you're struggling already i think that's a very hard thing to do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i think you already pay for the university and in this case someone is teaching you very advanced like from zero from from the beginning so i think it's also it's also an education type'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so maybe we should even pay for them actually they're there are some there are some companies that you do your internship and then you give some money to them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i definitely don't think that you should be paying for an internship i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i understand that you are getting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a you're getting some education or experience behind it but i definitely think that either way there should be some kind of stipend given and as far as a startup i definitely think that having to teach someone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then on top of having to then pay them is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and part of accepting an intern that is that you signed up to host an intern then you should be able to understand the the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the struggles that would come along with that although you are a a startup'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i just i feel like you definitely shouldn't pay but at the same time you should definitely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as a business you should know what you're getting into as far as reaching out to host the intern'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and i also think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you if you pay your interns you show them you you or one side is you really gain actual knowledge from them because a student from the university has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pretty recent knowledge about yeah which can be helpful for your business so you get actually very fresh information and that should be that should be worth something and also there are a lot of students which show which show their energy actually through making studies just to study and i think really this is this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'deserves respect and of course you you need to you need to pay the students for their work because they bring something into your business which can make you grow and they have good ideas of course and it's not it doesn't mean to intern doesn't mean to have or doesn't mean that you have someone who has no clue about nothing i don't really think that this is a fact so i think the opposite the opposite is is the fact and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that's another point where i just think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some companies should just recognize this a little bit more and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and umm yeah so the words by paying by paying them of course yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's what i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so so so sandy and kinana on the on the pro side so do you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you think that if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you think there's there's any higher risk of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'companies who simply abuse the internship system by by saying OK so there's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'enough people who would work for free because perhaps their desperate and so we're just gonna'",
        "'speaker_1': 'simply so fill our staff with with people who are just not getting paid to just get away cheaper do you do you think that it could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that that could be a thing yeah or or robbia'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think there should be an uh limitation for the internships intern interns that they can accept'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so like a quote'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes i definitely i mean i definitely believe it has the ability for to be abused absolutely i definitely think there probably are some companies out there that utilize interns in instead of having employees because they know that they can get that free labor and there are people who are willing to do it for free'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't think that's just straight across the board no i just think that i do believe that like robbie has said there should be a cat there should be a limitation on how many interns if you are going to have unpaid interns say you have paid interns i don't think that there should be a limit if you think you could take in X amount and you are going to pay them i don't think that you should be there should be a limit put on that but if you are going to have people working for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no monetary compensation compensation then you absolutely should not be able to take in as many as you'd like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i think there are different aspects here also from my own experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the first thing is these unpaid internships have a high risk of ending in a dark office just copying files all day that's one point so and for the yeah exactly this is one of my experiences actually and you can do nothing about it if you are in you are in and yeah that's one point and that's and you can you can avoid this but by paying all interns so bottom line'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes this situation is also very common in turkey like they are literally abusing the interns and they don't teach anything like important they they ask'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think that's that's across the world that's just one point and the other aspect what i think is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a question of the duration of an internship there are internships which are for one week or two and there are internships which goes for months and maybe i don't know all the systems worldwide but maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm there should be other solutions like micro microchips which means that you are an intern for specific projects'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm defined projects and not just your work here for half a year just copying files that's not and you can avoid this by just playing these interns or or be more exact what the internship is about and not a very long duration but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm shorter shorter terms yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and i like the idea like you said the a project base so one they are working on something they have an actual idea of what they're gonna be working on they're actually gonna be put to use in whatever field that they are trying to gain that knowledge and once that project is done then they can go about their way and they take on that experience that they learn from that project so i definitely think that's an assistant awesome'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'reputation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and also it sounds more organized than the others'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you can actually show in your CV that you have done this project it's i think it's better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well they i think what we can agree on is that it's really hard to to argue'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whether whether it should well whether intern should be paid or not because i think we can all agree that probably like over ninety nine percent of people who get into the job market are looking for money of course right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm but what do you think if before starting the internship if the if if the intern is signs for the for the free internship so they make an agreement that it's gonna be unpaid so what do you think about it is it still should be illegal or is it OK if the internship internship sorry if the intern is OK with this situation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i i still think it should it should shouldn't be OK i mean because at the same time they are agreeing that they understand that they're going in without pay accepting this opportunity for experience but we know anybody would absolutely rather be paid than so they're accepting what they can't accept they're not in a position to negotiate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rome'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so they're going to accept whatever they're given for for the experience but i just feel like anybody going into a situation would much rather have monetary compensation instead of just being paid and experience experience doesn't pay the bills experience doesn't you can't you can't keep your lights on with experience so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'most fragile'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah maybe i don't know maybe there's i i just thought maybe there's one exception and that it that it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well let me say it another way the these internships have different values i think it makes a difference if i work for or if i volunteer at a coffee shop or at mercedes mercedes benz or something like this or google in a silicon valley i don't know and maybe if such an internship is for a project and in a highly appreciated company or not appreciated but i think you know what i want to say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and where you really have a a high end internship from my side maybe this could be unpaid but that must be exceptional yes yes in this in this case you could think about it but the general the general internship should be paid now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but how can you make this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'clear like in the laws'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the exceptional part'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think if you're an exceptional company you absolutely have the ability to pay an intern so i think if you are a company with with with that much establishment you absolutely have the ability to pay your intern so i don't really think that would be i guess a a caveat in in that situation personally i feel like the the higher esteem you have the more of the ability you have more to pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm and i think if U M if interns could choose whether it should get paid or not then it wouldn't make any difference to what we have now that unpaid internships are still legal because everyone applying for an unpaid internships internship knows that they're not getting paid and they're still doing it so i think that wouldn't make any difference if interns could'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the truce'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think in this case uh some committees like european union they provide uh erasmus funding if you're doing your internship in another european country so i think in this case it's it is very helpful beneficial because the training gets money and the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'employee doesn't pay anything so it's a very beneficial relationship i think in this case'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that's a win win'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm but i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean as long as as long as there's compensation being provided that's all that really i think really matters'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or like some scholarships but again of course not everyone will be able to get benefits from this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and everybody should have access to to internships UM'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and not just people who who are not depending on on a payment or something like this everybody should just have access so there we have the first thing which is not which is not correct that it's not possible for everybody they they act it pretend it is but actually it isn't so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's that's one main issue in my opinion that yeah it should be available for everybody'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean it's it's interesting that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be in the position to let's say go to university or to have an unpaid internship i mean like in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would say in in most european countries it's uh it's uh much more affordable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but uh then like let's say in the US would you agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and and but still'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there are such high discrepancies in europe where uh like uh many kids from the working class they they still can't afford higher education and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh i i think that just goes to show how'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how slim really the chances are for you to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'take an unpaid internship and be OK with it like as sandy mentioned'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the most interns who are in unpaid internships are what did you say sandy more more more privileged'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well off i would say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my the monetary back is is better i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes so so so a certain group of people who are just uh more privileged'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for people who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh financially'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely i i mean i i just i i know i have friends that would you know wouldn't it wouldn't hurt them to take a unpaid internship but i mean myself personally i wouldn't be able to do that i i there's no way in the world i would love the opportunity but personally i couldn't take an unpaid internship because i have i have bills to pay i have mouths to feed and i i couldn't take that hit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my my time is already divided in so many ways that i'm i'm already struggling at the end of the day with making sure that things are taken care of so to try to add a job on top of the internship just wouldn't be feasible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
