        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you you draw the know before the interview if that was gonna be the case and then you wouldn't need to waste your time'",

        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i just need to pass the interview and that's it rather than having to pass over more hoops after thinking that i'm set is setting up'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it depends what it what what the jobs for and what was said they doesn't it and to use the mcdonald's example even though it's a job working at mcdonald's and you know what you said might not seem relevant twenty years ago on social media if you put something you know about terrorism or something terrible on there that would still be a red flag to me if i was an employer at mcdonald's and i was interviewing someone and i saw that on their social media i think that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and because as you said comedians are sometimes offensive which is part of their job because they they go into certain areas but there comes a question is there a lack of reliability with social media information because it only shows certain information and that in a certain way so can that be representative of a person 's actually beliefs and attentions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's very sorry it's very difficult and the context is very different when you're watching and listening a comedian and you understand all of the the you know the communication the body language the tone of voice all of those things which you don't get in a in a in a text so yeah the context is it depends on the context'",
