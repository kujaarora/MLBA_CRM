        "'speaker_1': 'follow discussion today is is the college degree more important than than one than on the job experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do any of you have like really strong opinions on on this subject'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i do i think that as far as on the job experience goes really nothing passes having that on the job experience i mean you can have certificate after degree after degree but unless you're you've gotten into the workplace and doing hands on things that degree doesn't really mean a whole lot so to me i think that for sure that hands on experience that work experience is going to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be more beneficial for you in the long run then a degree however it's hard to actually get that hands on work experience without the degree so it's kind of a double edged sword'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but you're not even my i think when i was looking at the question i'm just thinking that when we say important to me like valuable to employers right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like what employers value most'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh you know he it could be for anyone it could be for you personally it could be for your boss it could be for the economy in general or i don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh OK so yeah because i was thinking of that and they said like you know it really depends and from my point of view is from the point of employer like if i want to employ someone and i will say it really depends on the industry for example i'm from the engineering background and for us experience matters education is good because you know you are we believe that people with higher degree they have wider opportunity to learn from different like to learn different things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but experiencing the engineering is better but if when you talk about like for example teaching like if you have to go be a teacher or being education educator probably high degree is better than you know experience just how many years you have been teaching'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK what about you david'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i'm actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with taylor there i feel like everything works hand in hand'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like everything works and and end because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it a well educated person'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is still a well educated person gets a certificate a certificate pay for way to get the job and gives you advantage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now if you have an experience like it's just like someone who learns carpenter from a workshop without a certain group someone who goes to a technical school and learns carpentry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right he has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but i think it's not like you know the higher education when you say the experience i think higher education is is good to give you that you know the fact you experience as what taylor was saying you need that education to start getting into the job to get that experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no not not in every you know field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but how will you unless you unless you maybe your father has a shop or something that you can get experience but if you you you depend to get experience from job that you get hired probably how will you be hiring the first place'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nothing every'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that's exactly right because then if you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i mean for example if you work like in retail or as an actor or i don't know is a journalist'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even the freelancer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even if friend last night doesn't it doesn't need a certain'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the OK yeah so you have to be a freelance in the in the first place'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true yeah it in order to get some experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'get some experience and as a freelancer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then how are you going to get that freelancer experience if you don't have the yeah it would be great to have that work experience in order to get but to start out as a freelancer a lot of the times those people that are looking to hire their freelancers are looking for certificates or even references but how are you going to get those references unless you have that degree or that certificate that higher education kind of get your foot in the door'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think people more more or less are looking for what you can do now than with recommending you because i think right now people feel like it's easy to get recommendations later if you connected or if you're not able to pull up pull up the job right the recommendation is more or less useless so now look at someone in the software and computer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'computer world some write code and everything they won't even ask you they will just have you work somewhere you work on projects before let's see what you have done before'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah what's project you have to have project online that you have done'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'online that you've done not they don't wanna know who you worked with they wanna see what you did and they wanna confirm ohh you did this person or if you can do that then it's fine we can employ you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so i feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah that's a that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that's why it's like you know that's why it falls on the industry you you you you know if you are teacher where will you show that you you you told you know but you know for the ICT or in general that's i'm saying like the industry matters a lot because for ICT people we can just put your things online i can just sit in my home and and do some projects and i can show people and also as you are all saying i know i i'm kind of agreeing that you know experience like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'education this high education matters at the beginning of your career but look at people who are twenty thirty years down in their career they don't even find you know education they have like even important so even the the the level of your career is also i think it's also important it plays a role in it can be either oh so you are high education is important when you're starting your career but when you are ten years twenty years down the career path probably you don't even care to list your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's a good point because like if you look at a lot of the nurses nowaday in the hospital then like the nurses in the hospitals a lot of them that have been working as nurses for you know in america for twenty plus years most of them are just starting or they just had started out as registered nurses where now nurses that are just starting into the hospitals are they have the bachelor of science in nursing and there's that big push of that a lot of the RNS that are fifty sixty years old that are approaching retirement'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know even with the kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'need to go back and get their BSN which that doesn't make sense because they've had twenty years of experience in the industry and so it's like how are how is two more years of education going to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but do do you think it makes difference like if not only for the nurses themselves but you know for the care that can provide like their nurse with thirty years of experience versus the nurse with maybe ten years experience bought bachelor degree do you think there is a difference'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm but but now there comes another point you see there it is also another point of industry because let's say for example for nesses some you know some practice have changed you know you have a nested has twenty years and they know the things that were there the medicine the procedures that were there back twenty years and now like things change and maybe last year last two years they have to you you'll find that those who have been like having higher education and then they have learned those things it it it becomes more important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i feel like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even if then i'll i'll say even if i'm hiring if i'm hiring a medical person experience matters but also will be questioned myself are they going to be following the procedures that were there twenty years ago'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all they have updated themselves into the current'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there are great not great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so what's the nurses and with doctors and healthcare professionals they are required to do those continuing medical education courses so it's not just that they went to school twenty years ago and have been practicing just the same way for the past twenty years they have those continuing education courses so what i was saying is that referring to them having to go back for two years to get a comparable degree that doesn't it doesn't teach them anything that they haven't already learned on the job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that they haven't already been doing and haven't that they haven't already learned in those continuing education practices and that's just for nurses though i mean if my doctors then practicing the same for the past twenty years and he hasn't been doing any of the continuing education i don't want to go see her'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that's true yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but also also feel like in every profession education is very important because education brings you to a limelight of export of another level exposure you know in education they teach you more of the theoretical part than the practical part because their experience is the practical part right the the theoretical part gives you an advantage over someone who is not educated and is also in the same profession because when you're thought that when you are educated about it you know how to expand the business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'today's a business what is a profession you know how to even think the way better than somebody who has who has experienced because whether you like it or not whether you when you finish an education you will have to get an experience to be able to work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you have an education and you have an experience certificate and experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then it's an eye advantage more or less let's look at the tourism department the tourism vacation most people would like for you to be in charge of a tourism company you don't really need a certificate right you don't need a certificate to do that you just need experience but one thing the certificate puts you it gives you an edge over'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you need experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'someone without a certificate because when you post a certificate online when someone wants to patronize you when i see how this guy has a certificate which means his license enough'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they don't even care about your experience for the second it's pains away first it pains away for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but those you know yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's thursday and also in in areas in industry like that it also because we believe people with high degree they have more soft skills you know they can interact better that you have communication skills they have seen like they have been in a different environment where the the interact with different kind of people so the soft skills i trust the the people with high degree because of their soft skills i believe they have more soft skill than you know people don't with no higher degree but of course they have experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and also if if you are you if i'm hiring someone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it depends like i i might be looking for someone who is ready to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like learn different things because we we want people can learn fast and learn different things definitely i would look for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'higher degrees and experience because people with high degree they have wider you know the wider net of learning and and teaching themselves many things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it's people someone with experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure they're much more flexible they can always learn something new and change you know but i didn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly but someone with experience and no degree they expect just come and focus on that one thing that they know best and and nothing else'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that people would just experience on both sides'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly they're very they're very rigid they're not open to learn and they feel like you know somebody with experience that feels the ones who learn more we definitely want to get a degree with the experience there but most of them would not want to get that because they they believe that they are making enough money from the job already so it's this friday i believe it's the experience that matters but education comes along way because you will be instructed by the technical'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'technical part of every business every business has the technical part every job has the technical part it has come i i could education you learn communication skills you learn the business how to do a business plan how to meet people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how to solve each problem and the war as the world goes on technology is improving every day'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as more as you are educated you have to learn more because whatever you are doing this this technology has improved so much that it can be solved with easier ways now so now someone needs experience that they can solve the problem in forty minutes and someone with education can solve it in five minutes that's just a basic different now when someone with the five minutes once you extend to the forty minutes person the person will be like no don't worry this the way i know it this is the best way which is not right so i feel education is very very important for everyone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for every profession at least a little bit of education not everybody can not all progress'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what well but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know look at it from the perspective of the you know if you're trying to hire somebody for the certain position and you're choosing between the person with education who of course will sometime later will probably will be more flexible and will bring more for the company but it will take some time for them to learn the skills that you need right now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and then versus the person who already have the skills who can start working tomorrow and already you know can start doing what you need them to do immediately versus like you know for this person they they it will take them some time to learn this what they need to do in your company versus experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and and you know that's why we we are saying it really depends to the high like if you are hiring do you want someone who can lend broader things and and be beneficial in the future or you want something to be done now like for example you had a person you are depending on and they just dropped the job yesterday and you need someone to fill that hole as soon as possible probably you need to go for someone with experience but so it it's it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a eight like it's it's a question of saying like it depends it depends on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the situation at hand'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you need someone who will be beneficial in the future then you have to ask someone with high degree but if you want someone to fill a position now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and one thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you really some you need someone who is ready to go with the experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then yeah so then if you're even looking though like from the perspective of the employer like say you have two say you have two very viable candidates and they both have the same amount of experience but now you have one with a degree and one without a degree you're gonna go with the one they have the same amount of experience you're going to go most likely nine times out of ten you're gonna go with the person that also has the degree that kind of goes with the experience now the other the other thing could be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but these people they also they will question you they will ask more money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which you're not necessarily want to pay them more money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they they will be like yeah we disagree we we think you need to do it in a different way and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the that's why i put the companies do inference'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and it you don't want people to disagree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but you know that that that thing you call disagreement i believe that's what you you need you know like if if employees open to challenge because that's another advantage of high degree because you have people who can challenge your decision who can you know ask questions who can think outside the box'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know when company doesn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and and that that's what i'm saying like if if that's the kind of a person you are looking for then you want someone with high degree and something else that they've been one that is nowadays not one that in but probably expected it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like big companies now they don't require high degree like google apple apple and some other big companies netflix they don't why high degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the reason the reason why most of those companies don't take people with higher degrees'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we are doing tech work so they can employ someone they can they can employ a mechanical engineer with a very good software developer into the position of a software developer as long as you are good with it they they just want to see your work like i said at first the most companies want to see what you can do what you have done before that is what they wants now that is the tech companies those are what happened with tech companies google tech companies any tech company that's what that's that's what that's what they do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah yes yes the technique that you can show'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah they always take off'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well if you're looking for it from an engineering perspective'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whether you have experience you need a little bit of education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because most companies now we notice something is most companies when they want when they want to employ people they employ people with experience with greater experience first with education then they're not employ a lot of people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who are just educated don't have experience then those ones they put them on their intention so they start learning from those that are experienced so by the time the company grooms them for a long time the company pays them low after the internship and the company sees that this ones these are ones the good the company filters them and takes employees that are good not ones that are good now starts with the basic salary which means the company is always gaining'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they they taught them and they're using them as manpower so for someone who is not educated and has a little bit of experience it is at a disadvantage for them because at that kind of a job offer most of them will struggle to get in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's frustrating though is that oftentimes then with the if you have like that degree you're you're seeing a lot now that those higher education degrees are becoming more and more obsolete like you were saying david that it really does kind of look more towards that experience like with that software development with the computer technical skills and even like if you look at some people that go into photography or like the performing arts even like categories and it's like OK so you're getting a degree in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and but but you know nowadays also the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know art or photography when that degree is not going to do as much as like that experience that work experience that you're really gonna learn hands on and so like you were saying it's really just depends on the industry right like i you know it really just depends on that industry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well like for example the the liberal arts or arts in general degree the the idea there would be that this degree will give you the accessibility that you don't do we know one type of art you can always switch to a different way you can kind of it gives you broader understanding of how art works'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and flexibility but also nowadays you know we we also uh equating experience and had degrees so what i've seen mostly is like ten years of experience is equal to a bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know if it needs fifteen years of experience to be equal to masters or twenty to be equal to PH D'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'admitted to PH D'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but what i have seen is ten years of experience is equivalent to a bachelor degree looks like look to me it looks like over valuing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the higher degree because ten years of experience is a lot especially like in careers like engineering and computer science that's a lot of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like yes to compare to adjust the bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there are a lot of you know certificates that you need to get the standards you need to learn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah for for for certain kind of engineering but for example computer engineering you don't need certificates and and stuff but ten years of experience in computer engineering that's a lot compared to compare with the person that is coming out of college with a bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's like if you put the person with the bachelor 's degree next to a person with ten years of experience and then give them the same task like who who do you think 's gonna get that fast'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no yeah it's it's not like that is very unfair comparison but in in job description like in hiring like the job description i've seen that if you have either ten years of experience or a bachelor degree and i was like wow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i feel like it's all it's in favor bachelor 's degree due to the fact that when so when someone to ten years experience and someone with a bachelor 's degree compete for a job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most people most company will try to favor the person with the degree for with the experience force right which would not be in favor of the person with the degree and that will cost a lot of graduates being jobless because now imagine someone who just graduated today and wants to get a job and the job offers days you need three years of experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which in that job offer they're not taking any'",
        "'speaker_2': 'internship just straight up job which means the graduate we just graduated fresh they cannot have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they cannot get into the job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can't get into the job so they have the disadvantage now but at if that kind of a graduate does can use the internship it did in school in varsity and the experience they use university they use it to qualify him and like OK let's check you out let's compare you let's where you with this person then interview will be conducted for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'based on different things different different standards'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right interviews with people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah i think but but those are what the employers that are doing probably i'll say that also they're still doing wrong with like people with higher degree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they get when it comes to pay they get paid more and and that's what we like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'send a message that had degree is important but if even if we experience and high degree like the higher degree people get paid more even compared to people with experience and probably that's what he's sending message at the at some in some industry it it makes it like high degree is important because of the pay but you know not the productivity and and maybe the titles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you need to pay them all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the pace is usually a lot more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's also a good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but should it be more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'she should be well you or degree more than an experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say no because if you you compare like let's take the comparison of ten years experience and and the bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it for me to be fair the the person who is ten years of experience probably to be paid more than a person with bachelor degree but i have seen people with bachelor degrees getting paid more than people with ten years experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they shouldn't be getting paid the same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh i think pizza'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then simply because they have the that bachelor degree ohh maybe masters'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think someone with the degree should be paying more than'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then someone with their experience really been needs to get it degree it's very very expensive'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's so you know you're getting paid what you you you what you paid in college'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at morning'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no not what you do college but this process of learning you know is dedicating your time you you be you in college you doing a lot of research'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's really close to your final years in college talk less of you do masters'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but don't you think don't you think don't you think a person who is in the job for ten years the the learning process for ten years and someone with let's say bachelor they did their bachelor for three or four years some others maybe two years'",
        "'speaker_2': 'good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i want someone with someone someone someone with the with the work experience is getting paid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not like they were good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is getting paid to learn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'he's getting play paid in the in getting their experience what is internship or not mostly they get paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but also that there's someone who can also be paid if they want to work while they're studying right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it's more or less like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'look did that is to support that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then it's also like what are they getting paid for from the job right like if you're gonna be paying them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for like OK you're paying them more because they have a bachelors like what are you paying them for then versus like a person who has ten years of experience like you're paying them for their hard work where like a person with a bachelors you're not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they don't get it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly because they were delivered'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the person who the bachelor is they they need to you know pay their student loans they probably would not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'agreed to work for you know less than a certain amount of money just because of the loans'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because of the loan but but then i don't think it's the job of influence to carry that burden and i just don't i'm not i don't think so because the employer cannot pay you for something that you like you haven't you have not produced yet so they are paying you for for learning in college while they are not you are not even employed by them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's the it's given the employees are weighed them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the employees played quality not quantity'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is that what you mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah OK so so if so so that means that that means you're saying someone with high degree is it will produce more quality work because they have high degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'big because by the time the employer employee'",
        "'speaker_1': 'theoretically'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the the they can learn more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then leave room for for learning more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's what the company is using them because all it's higher degree the company tends to use them more for a lot of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'odd and technical jobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and that's what we were saying it it depends if that's what the employer want but if what if employer wants someone who can work on specific thing like for example a company has this specific machine that need to be operated by someone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and uh that's somewhat so if you have two candidates one candidate has a PHD and another one has ten years experience operating that machine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you're going to go with the person who has the ten years experience because they can just get right into it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and with him'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because what you want is that specific experience to manage that machine and not someone who will will learn ten twenty other machines in the in that industry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then it will be stated on the application'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's as we stood there on the application like even even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly so i'm saying like it really depends on the situation at hand when the employees hiring'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because look at even looking at the tech world when they want to apply for a job if you want to apply for a a they want to apply for a front end designer if they say we want a front end designer yeah everybody can apply when they're specific they said a front end designer that can use view or react then a lot of people are going to draw back'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that only few are specific people with experiencing that so when you're talking about a machine if the if the employer said i want somebody who can operate and a a machine and as a stencil using it it's all that PHD doesn't have experience in that aspect but it's also a mechanical engineer he won't apply for that because he's expecting them on the interview day to test him on how to use the machine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK what good we are mainly looking at from the perspective you know who will be hired and how they need to be hired but what do you think if it will look perspective of you choosing how you're gonna you know spend your time and money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like and in this way do you think it's better to go for the degree or do you think it's better to maybe try to get hired in a lower position and then grow inside of the company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'while getting experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's better to go for the education'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for me provided that money is there i would want to go for degree like if money is not a problem i want to go for higher degree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because i have the i have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree with you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which i degree whoever is coming low from the scratch when you have an higher degree you can see them down back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but you also can say that you know if you're i don't know eighteen years old you may be not very sure what you want to do and then in if at that point you are trying to get for the degree it's rather hard to do to make this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you got'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and that's why you want to go for a degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'session versus that if you're trying to get in the you know field you feel it first you maybe then decide that it's not from you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no i i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and then you can no but the thing is that degree yeah the degree give you the wider net you can you can choose like for example you go get your high degree and then you can start testing if you want to test but other way around probably because with experience it it means going deeper but with her degree means going wider'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and now you're already twenty thousand dollars in debt'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if you go and get high degree then you you you have a wider net you can you can come back and try this one go a little bit deeper and say like OK i don't like this one i'm going to switch and then do this one go a little bit deeper and say OK i like this one so i'm going to dive deep into this but if you start with the experience go to one company and gain experience and then down the line in front like i don't like this you are coming out you see how hard is it to switch like it it's really hard to switch to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but just like you were saying like it's just if they're going'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then again the situation is if money wasn't an issue right where like if anybody could just go get a a higher'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah if might know yes if money wasn't there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no well it always an issue'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly and that's what like so not so a higher degree is it going to be accessible to everyone where experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is is more accessible to more people not saying that it's gonna always be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know whatever but it's you're gonna be able to hopefully be able to find some or a way to get that experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'without having to you know fork out twenty forty fifty thousand dollars and student loan debt'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think i think what is good is that when students are on break before going for their third degree they should start going for internships they start going to get experience little by little from what if for those that have known what they want to do right they can start doing to probably mechanical engineer the parents can drop them by them or workshop they can start learning little by little because these are all things that add so experience right so by the time they enter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but i i think nowadays you know most of the degrees that you're getting you're getting internships you know earlier like second third year that that's very common to have the kind of industry specific internship'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yo no it was twenty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they will get internship now is good but the thing is most of the intentions are like six months seven months'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nine so it's not up to a year right that is demanded at at worst it's twelve months calculating it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'three months for second year three months in third year and six months year in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in forty eight especially for engineering in some parts of the world so i feel like that's a year that's a year full of experience right but sometimes most employers tend to wanna ask for two years sort of two years experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i think when students are on break when if they can add to their they can add to their experience level by trying to fill up the gas like going to workshops working that will add to their experience level so by time they were done with degree they will be able to compete at the highest level with everybody because they will be like yes i have a degree and yes i have an experience but we're not have experience obviously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah of course comma combination of both is good but but like i'm trying to understand your point if the combination is good but do you think what would like one is better than the other that's what i'm trying to think because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i feel like i i think i i think the both work and in end because in the world we are right now everything is competitive every everything is competitive you can have all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yeah yeah a balance of two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the balance of the two is what everyone needs and it takes hard work a lot of hard work to balance the two because to balance one is even stressful enough right but to balance the two it needs a little bit of hard work and the hard work queue that is done at that time will give the students all the personal and edge over others because no matter when you get to an interview and you present the yeah i'm a student i just graduated have a degree and i have work experience now they will be curious how did you get your work experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then call me in this you are someone who put in an artwork so in the interview you get an edge over someone who just have the degree early or someone was just experience only you may not have experience up to ten years'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but with the leads you have it means your neck yeah some experience gives you an edge it will it it the company will be at at peace that they will be teaching you everything just the basics that you have you have you know the basics already just have to catch up with the rest on the way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but some experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but did you know that that's kind of nonsense that it's better to be healthy and wealthy versus poor you know and sick like of course but but usually we have to choose'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah choosing one over the other but yeah but i think we're circling back to saying that it really depends on the industry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's really depend on the industry because our in some industry high degrees better in some other industry experience is better'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so something is better is important but probably based on the industry that you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah do with you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know yeah you are in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well i mean the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and what's what is needed uh i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well if it's employer what the employer want if the employer wants someone is with sophie specific in experience or they want someone who can go either and do things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah do they want them like right now or some group'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and they want right now they can teach them you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that all really depends on those those factors'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well OK guys you know thank you so much it was an interesting conversation and i hope i'm gonna hear you more of you you know for more discussions and we're gonna have more topics'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thank you very much'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nice it's nice'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
