        "'speaker_1': 'but don't many internships of opportunities to get college credits and return for work so even if you're not getting a paycheck you are still getting paid indirectly by earning college credits so you reduce the number of overall credit hours required to graduate which increases your likelihood of graduating on time as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it depends on the field that you're going into some do not some degrees nowadays require an internship as part of it but that doesn't mean it's counted as credit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for them to have the amount of credits that they have to have to graduate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but what a credit system if it would be widened out help to mitigate that you are not getting paid'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so with those credits being given for free then'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yes exactly but it is a it is a form of compensation yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but the internship still would be unpaid but it is a form of compensation yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or i can see if it's an internship too where the where the person is guaranteed a job at the end of their'",
        "'speaker_2': 'college career'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think that's a good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you know if they're guaranteed a job with a salary and stuff at the end of their college career from doing their internship i can see in that way not being compensated because you're also guaranteed a position within the company'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i i would agree with that as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and yet i wonder if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i wonder if that's a guarantee that any company can really give though because you don't know from year to year if you're gonna have layoffs or something so what's to stop them from saying yeah we'll offer you a job get their work out of them and then say ohh sorry we're having layoffs or we're not we have a hiring freeze or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that's sort of a'",

        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're hoping that it will be true at the end but also too who's guilty who's to guarantee that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they hauled off for like say a summer to do this internship and it ends up only lasting two weeks because they don't the company doesn't need them as long as they thought they would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK that's another thing yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think uh for company it is i mean the company should have an interest to invest in the future right and i think if they have an intern the the proft or the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the pro side of that would be if they can offer them a job after the insurance will after they finish with college'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that they have already seen the company they know the company and they know that the job is a good fit for them so i think both benefits right the company and the intern'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's a good one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if it isn't a good fit and it's not something they want to do like for me an internship gives a person a chance to find out when they're in college is this really a field that i wanna go into before i graduate and spend all this time applying for positions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then they feel they get into the internship in the field that they thought they wanted to go into and realize this isn't what i wanna do at all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on the other thing is randall to your point that your daughter 's gonna be working like forty to sixty hours a week i think there's a lot of companies that take advantage of those internships and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i it seems like there should be some sort of restrictions at what point are we not even paying the minimum wage or it just feels like a form of abuse to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to not to to make them to work certain long hours and not give them something in return other than the experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i i mean i agree i but she's also going to be having all of her living expenses paid too so but she'll get a smaller salary like akita said instead of getting what they would pay a full time employee'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so do they typically not take any other classes at all it's strictly that internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes usually when you're doing an internship it's strictly that internship for that semester'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so when i when i did my internship we had one day that we'd go to school to do some training'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm and so for me it was a even though the pay wasn't the full salary for that position'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thought i was doing i was the administrative assistant for the local council and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that one day to study and get a certificate at the end to get some sort of qualification that felt more of a bonus for the lack of payment for the hours but we didn't have something in place where you working forty or sixty hours it was a standardised thirty seven and a half hours which in the UK we class as full time hours it wouldn't it would never exceed that so you did feel protected in a way that people your employer wasn't going to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'abuse you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i hope you use if you use the internship so it felt very equal and fair and i did feel like i got a lot out of it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm so i if something like i would agree with something like that if if you didn't get a salary but maybe got benefits such as they paid towards your cost of living or like you had like accommodation included or something like that to ease that stress and burden then i would agree with i would i would agree with them not paying if you were being compensated elsewhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i mean i i think it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when we were when i was growing up you did an internship and you didn't get paid you were getting you were doing it for the experience but i think in general everything has changed and it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's hard enough to get workers nowadays and so not compensate if you compensate them it's more enticing for them to go do that internship for your company then to not pay them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'going back to what you said randall so basically'",
        "'speaker_1': 'back in the day it's used to work that you did not pay internships or internships would unpaid but in today's time it doesn't work so the question is what has changed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i think it is because back in the days you would be living with family and your family would support you and it was it was more more easier to do something like an internship cause you'd have the support whereas nowadays due to the cost of living crisis due to the culture change and things like that you're not you haven't got the same support that you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would have had before and i think generationally'",
        "'speaker_4': 'expectations are changing culture is changing and so you don't have the same fall back that you would have had back in the days when family was different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and just the general cost of what the tuition is it's it's just outrageous as compared to what it used to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a has a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'has it gone up that much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what i can tell you i was in school many many years ago but believe it or not my tuition was six hundred dollars a semester and now we're talking something like twenty thousand or more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we paid twenty four thousand a semester'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but isn't the problem then not with the company but rather with the universities charging such high tuition fees'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and that's where i think you know the the compensation doesn't come from the company then the university should offer some kind of discount or something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i like the idea of credit'",

        "'speaker_3': 'OK go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i said i'm i like the idea of credits or something that will go towards'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the you know the the the the degree or whatever it is that used to doing that college or university i like the idea that this one year will somehow go towards that and whether that is a lessened your your enrollment fees or whether it goes towards accessing a certain degree like it has to be if it if it helps you progress in your education'",

        "'speaker_2': 'and of course every company is going to run their company different so you would be bringing other experience to another company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from doing an internship if you decided to go to a different company later'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and like i said as much as they think they should be paid too i i would think you might get into problems with like if someone was pursuing a something in nonprofit organizations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm doubting that a lot of nonprofit organizations would have money to pay for an internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and maybe there could be some alternative methods of compensation but again to make it illegal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think you would just lose a lot more opportunities for students'",
        "'speaker_4': 'finally'",
        "'speaker_4': 'definitely because it with internships i'm not sure how it it is in america but in the UK we have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh like internships that happened during the summer so it's usually between when someone is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'left high school or left college going to university and they've got the summer holiday so they will do an internship just to build experience and just to add something onto their resume or CV so a lot of the times they are working with charity organizations so they won't receive a payment but the charity will find ways to provide accommodation if it's in a different city or something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm just to just to make it a possible for somebody to not be out of pocket if they were leaving city or something but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i i do feel like the word illegal sounds a bit harsh and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm but the idea that young people shouldn't be taking advantage of there has to be some some sort of policy or somewhere that says that they shouldn't they have to have like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a minimum amount of sorry a maximum amount of hours that they can do in a week it should never i don't believe it should exceed more than forty in my opinion i feel like that's definitely taking advantage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh sorry just let me let me just interject one second doreen i'm sorry your mic is open the whole time it distorts a bit the audio'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i can't imagine doing that myself'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if you if you could just watch that please thank you sorry uh randell go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like where my daughter may be doing more hours and forty it's because of her degree and they would have to watch stuff longer than'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what forty hours may being in a lab and stuff so that's the reason why but it also too they would compensate them like if they did over the forty hours one week they would compensate them the next week so it balances out but it also gives them the experiences of being in the labs and learning what those hours can be like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean i think an interesting point that ikita brought up that maybe the duration is also the problem like i think a a student would more readily agreed to a summer internship let's say that is for a few weeks then doing an internship that lasts a semester for example right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you also get into the issue though of people the students work a summer job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to get the money to pay for that college so if they're using that summer time for an internship and they're not getting paid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're in the hole again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but here i mean in the united states too akita we have internships that can be a week long like over spring break or over christmas break and then you can do during the semester or you can do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'over the summer so there's a lot of flexibility in actually winning to an internship but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going back to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know should it be illegal i don't know if illegal is the right word'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we should be using because when you think of illegal you think of breaking a law'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be able to the question is if we if they should exist or if they shouldn't exist'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i mean i think paid internship should exist and it doesn't have to be the fault like we've said the full amount that everybody makes as a hired on permanent position but it should be compensated in some way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i agree that they should be compensated in some way if it's not if they're not getting any payment and they should definitely be some sort of advantage with them in terms of whether that's a credits towards college or you know point points or something or whether that's just having'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh cost to cost cost covered such as accommodation and transport'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe if they have a canteen in the in the workplace they're allowed to eat from there for free or discount or something that has to be some benefit for the individual they can't just be i don't believe that they should be working for absolutely nothing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i can give you some insight i'm from germany and the way it works here is that internships and generally are paid but there are over the holidays short internships which last one week ten days two weeks which are unpaid but they're regarded more about their regarded as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the intern or the person can have a look into the company and see if that job and that company might be fit for them so it's more like a an exploration'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like a a a work experience yeah we we call that work experience here in the UK where you might spend a week or two in a company just to get a feel of if if it's the right fit for you and for them to to see how you are working as well but then the option usually is afterwards'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'potentially a position of potentially study to get into that position so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this again i feel like you'll receive something out of it at the end so if if it might not be a monetary payment but you are still potentially getting compensated i believe because she could get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe the duration of the internship how long it lasts'",
        "'speaker_2': 'should be something to look into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like you said if it's a week long it's more of a trial by error to see if it is actually a natural fit or not where if it's a whole summer where you're doing you know three two months to three months that is a different situation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think the the argument also there is in one or two weeks you're not bringing any value to the company but if you are there for let's say an internship the last six months you actually you're working you're bringing value to the company so in this case you should get some kind of compensation right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh definitely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah definitely i agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with that completely because if you're only there for like you said if you're only there for a week or two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're basically just learning being introduced'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to how the company runs and what the company does'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where if you're there for a couple of months you're actually doing the work alongside of everybody'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and well i think it can actually be harmful to the economy economy with companies taking advantage of insurance while trying to save money and it could be tempting to fill entry level jobs with unpaid interns or two instead of recent graduates'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the problem with the graduates now is they think that they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they don't come in at making the money that we would have come in at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they get they expect to be paid more so paying an not paying an internship or paying an internship even half the company is saving money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah true yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
