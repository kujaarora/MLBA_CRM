        "'speaker_2': 'in a way that a sport can contribute to our kids uh mental and physical health'",
        "'speaker_3': 'my steam is really that a child has to be has to do sport as a child they have to do and and they lean toward team sports you know they are individual sports probably talking about that i'll probably choose personal development but if it is teams support there is so much to gain in team sport as a child which also include personal development in in in as part of the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the game and i believe that is very very important for a child than just doing the personal development but and the the thing is the personal development part can be done at any age when you grow up but playing sports and and being active it it's hard to do when you grow up so just do it when you a child and i think that is more important than personal development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well sure yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i see i basically agree with pager and my great about being active in sports playing an important role in person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can you can you can you talk a little bit louder paragon i don't think i can hear you properly'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well yes yeah i mean may may account all of you as a with my own child experience and it's like i i really hated sports i was made to do that i and like i'm was very nerdy kid and like i was literally made to do that i hated it with the burden passion i still hated a lot a lot much less now because nobody is making me to do that but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like so actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right so that's what my actual point was you know so you know a parent you know it should not be forced on a kid because when it's forced i don't know maybe the kid doesn't enjoy it builds up a lot of pressure and at such a young age kids don't know how to handle that kind of stress and usually when we are talking about a sport here it involves win and loss and at a very tender age if a student is not if a kid is not you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know trained or coached probably to take a win in the same way as a loss to understand that thing in a sport it sometimes it takes a toll on me emotionally but physically i say some kind of physical activity is definitely important because you know if it's not just about fitness but it really improves your health also and going forward your physical health definitely makes plays a major role in on your mental health'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'alright so i think it is important but it shouldn't be worse than a kid'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but also you mentioned about the the the emotion i think the emotion is very important yes in emotional intelligence with because this world is all about you know emotions and meeting people and working with people even when you grow up so i very much agree with you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exact'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because of that emotional intelligence if if your child to go and do personal development you know that is probably more and i'm i'm assuming it is more individual personal development which really the the child will just be alone or growing up you know someone who just you know isolate yourself and and do your personal development and then read your personal development you know books and and but you don't have leadership skills you don't have and then the many practical practical leadership skills and practical emotional intelligence'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which open up a lot more to you know personal development even with without the you know intentionally going to do personal development in the in the sports you also get personal development in in a way practically'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i absolutely agreed with the falcones one point that right coaching is very important in a sport so to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and not forcing the child yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly right so both'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly yeah you know like maybe you need to expose the child'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no but but but here is the contradiction here like you you you're saying you know the the the they need to participate but we do not need to force them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly maybe going forward the tile to multiple things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you don't have to force them you you don't have to force them but but you know the child can be kept to try different sports and find which one they like you don't have to like you have to play rocket you have to play soccer no just yeah try a little bit of soccer will like it no i don't OK let's do whatever football you like it or no let's do then basketball let's do kayaking let's do swimming and it's very likely the child will find something they like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have you have have you met children'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tiffany'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and if we do it's a child like you nikita who hates sports i hope you don't hate all the sports it's just that you didn't get time to try to try all sports and find out which one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well i kind of you know my margarita i feel jealous for the school that you were going to because they were they offering all these sports at the same like did you had such a huge choice i mostly had skin'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no no no that's actually my my school didn't have any sports more than just you know running and and running around but at home you know the extracurricular activities you do in summer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because it's cheap you you you you you just tell them to run and they run yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah but in summer you are at home and also after school you are at home you could do those other extracurricular activities on weekends you know i may experience i grew in the village in a village and you don't have to to organize your spot you just get outside people are kicking balls and you have your local coach and you you kick balls and the coach is there to coach anyone who happened to appear in the field so those are informal but they're still sports they're still team and we have a coach and and and those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'kind of things swimming i i i did swim in the river we don't even ever swimming pool or something but for those who like swimming and we we had a rib and we did swim in the river so it it's really i think it's about a child being exposed to several spots and here we are we are talking in the urban environment if you expose the child to several spots which appear to be a lot more formal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's fine yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and needs time and now it also needs parent to be there that that that's something we didn't get to anywhere young so the pattern need time for the parent and need time for the child but try to expose the child into different sports and and try to see which one they would like i believe it's more important than trying to send a child to personal development classes and personal development coaches and also giving the books and i believe we are talking about the traditional personal development is more about the class environment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'probably a little bit of coaching but no activities no no you know physical activities and that is very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's very bad for itself the specially looking yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i think you know the tradition social please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's also about you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's just running or just playing some outdoor games maybe they might not involve all the rules of actual support but even that is important the fun part of it the play is very important for a child so that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm today'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh you know he gets the those social social skills and the that sportsman's spirit and the teamwork it's not like you have to enroll your kid to a particular sport or to particular'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh you know ohh school yeah so they can they can find find even out of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because because then you force them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because when you are forcing a kid then ultimately the fun part is getting lost some somewhere and you know eventually the kid might lose interest in this but and you know they might find excuses to get out of it or something like that so it should never be a force if if a parent is maybe enrolling a kid into something it's definitely because they find it that it will be beneficial in some way so they should also find ways to keep the kid interested in it but also i would like to definitely mention another point that when we talk about sports'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we only speak about outdoor sports and physical activity but i think as a kid my parents also expose me to chess now chess is not like a sports sport it's an indoor game but it is a very good mental activity you know how much like i think in the growing years especially in the very early stages'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how much is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh i think the mental activity is a little bit more important for me than the physical activity like not as a sport i can say because i think the analytical skills and the logical skills are maybe the problem solving skills these skills are mostly developed at a very tender age for a kid and you know the grasping power it keeps decreasing as we grow up so i think i would prefer my cleared to enroll or i would encourage or expose my kid to more sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's where there is more mental activity or exercise and yeah i would not you know totally exclude them from physical activities but according to me both are important provided you strike the right balance between them because overall we are speaking about a personal development and that will come through both of them you can't neglect any of them that's what i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and i think you probably a point now i i see in the schools nowadays they try to integrate personal development in the curriculum'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from my personal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh so probably the the children don't have to choose either O but they will get a balance of both so i'm just saying what century is saying is this is what somehow is happening because i see my kids they they get personal development'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi'",
        "'speaker_4': 'getting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh kind of classes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well probably once a week or twice a week but also PO is there you know physical education is there for the sports for them to do sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are you happy with them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but if it's either ohh i will lean towards the spots but but also the approach of balancing is is probably the right approach'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'alright some kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yeah i think the right balance is important'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even though the the children don't get to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get it and also when they balance you know balance is different for different people like what i think is the right balance may be completely different from what another parent would think is the right balance for their kid right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'health problems'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yeah based on what they they they feel like their children will need to get yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so from my personal experience of growing up i was never involved in sport but i was involved in dance so i i have done all kinds of dances follow group dance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not true that that's also a physical activity yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i bet that's also a sport i believe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like it is something like you get fit by doing that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'great so even even artistic skills like that you know it involves teamwork leadership'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'definitely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'today'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so it also involves you know uh getting rid of your social anxiety it makes your kid you not use stressed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stage fright definitely yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you know i'm trying to imagine the children the child who go through possible like go the the personal development path and in my mind i see i and i might be biased but i see a a child with a chubby child i don't want to say a fat child but a chubby child who is very miserable probably he or she she has a lot in in in the head about personal development and probably reading a lot of books but through'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i get it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'throw that cherry in a class or in a work environment when they grow up probably they don't even know how to interact with others'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that that actually happened'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's what they see like that's the picture that's a picture i'm having in my head'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but you know like the the way how you describe it so it what you're offering it will make an extroverted kid very happy the ones who like to run around i would kind of like it really it's it's not a great environment for the introverts who you know prefer reading and maybe more like games that involve chess or i don't know some puzzles and things like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you you are right but probably we have to have i'm i'm just looking at this child twenty years ahead and our work environment our our community environment doesn't they don't favor introverts that's one thing unless we change some things and say OK we favor introverts but but even even the way we do evaluation in in work environment the evolution don't even favor introverts like we want the social people extroverts to interact'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'book come on somebody somebody has to moderate the the discussions like that so that's why you need an interval'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'probably yeah but we it's it's i'm not saying we don't need introverts we we need introverts but trust me introverts are not people who'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if i don't agree with that i totally agree with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh cannot interact with other people it's just that they they can but they don't want or they don't feel happy like other people but this child who will go through personal development track and not sports will not be only an introvert but will be antisocial is an an antisocial person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly maybe that that's correct because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so this is because i believe introverts they they are social but they just don't enjoy being around people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that's why we're gonna make them they get we're gonna make them to love this post we're gonna make them to to do the sports and they will become happy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think i think i think introverts also can you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think in we can't make them love the sport i think the maximum we can try is to make them get exposed to as many spots as possible so that maybe they get a chance to something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah so they can choose'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's what i was saying like even if you're an introvert you can find peace with you know your kind of sport like say swimming or some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'today'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like the individual sports yes you don't have to play a team sport yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'individual ones right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'destiny'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i finished and i think chess is one of the best options for an introvert and i'm saying that's from personal experience like you wouldn't believe that like i am i'm you know coming on to this platform i don't know putting my opinions out in front of some people whom i'm speaking to the first time but as a kid i was not very confident and i when siegel said that she was involved in dance and it helped her self confidence so i totally agree to that or maybe i connected at that point because i was into music'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i do too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like after i i think maybe when i was in second grade or something i entered into music and then slowly i started performing in groups first because i was very scared to go on stage alone and then slowly after two three years of training i got confidence that OK i am not a bad performer so slowly i started performing you know alone also and that definitely helped with myself confidence with how i present myself to people and definitely with my state flight i'm not scared to talk to anybody'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm not scared to introduce myself to someone right now ten years back this was not me so here definitely extra curriculars has played an important role'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah that's my point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and one more thing is you also you know get used to the low losses as well even if you're not doing word uh you you learn to accept your losses you that sportsman spirit so you know let it go and do better next time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes exactly today'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but again as i said at the beginning you know just like how a good coaching is important when you experience when a loss in a sport similarly when you're playing individual sports or you know looking at individual performances then i think here the most important role is played by maybe your homeroom teacher or your parents about how you take it after you come back from a competition or when you get a result or when you are getting judged by somebody it may be sports made be education maybe you know you get a report card after attending a test now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how they're doing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what comes in the report card or what happened in your game and how that affects your day to day life that definitely depends on your parents also but i think if if a kid is coached or looked at by the parents properly to accept wins and the losses in the same way and you know taught that nothing is permanent a game means sometimes you win sometimes you lose but you have to play for the love of the sport not for winning or losing so you know that's the most important thing that a sport'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and also for the sake of being active'",
        "'speaker_4': 'teachers that exactly that's the most important take back that a kid should game from a sport and that's how or that's when it will help him in the personal development otherwise it will definitely go negative so not just playing sports is important but also teaching why you're playing the sport and what is the take back that you're taking home after playing this that's the most important thing for me for a kid'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you know that totally depends upon how you're teaching them or you know it because mostly you know kids they adapt from their parents so you know how you teach them or what they are listening at going on at home they pick up a lot from the parents so the coach and the parents for me play a lot of important the most important role about why a kid loves or hates sports or kid loves or hates education it mostly depends upon the parents and teachers around him that's what i think but yeah the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in education and sports voter important provided you strike the perfect balance between them that's what i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right and i think you know for most sports can be a medium to you know went up their negative energy or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i you know channelize all their you know negative things exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'excessive energy yeah you know it has to went out somewhere so that it's not building up and you know coming out and a wrong way correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's true yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but you know i'm also i'm i'm i'm trying to think what what is personal development'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we are taking it in a traditional way it's like you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but i think here we moment like person like personal development in general like that's how you that's how you get better and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in general like you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'getting better like how to manage your time how to manage your feelings something like that just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well all your social skills so you know logics i mean maybe physical education like like physical activities'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it can meet them thanks for the different people you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah and it's OK so so this is is the same that do we need alone it it's it's more theoretical and harder doing it in a through sports i think it's it's a better way i just wanted to understand how'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but yeah OK OK but then let's discuss you know the kind of the reassure there because also when i was growing up i had a lot of friends who like in a semi professional sports so since like five or six they will take into the coaches and you know that that was most part of their life and like you could talk to them maybe half an hour a day and then it was it because all the time they were they were training and like i always thought it was you know maybe too much but this is what needed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is the bad part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean they became the professional athletes after that so that helped but that's kind of like a rather specific path'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to to to make their parents happy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i i i don't think they had a choice like you know when you're five years old what choice do have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you don't have a choice and that's what i'm saying you know the thing is as a as a kid you are you are fulfilling your parents desire they want to have this this child that is is is show is a show for some athlete and and and stuff but but and and that's what we discussed the earlier the way you introduce a child in to sports'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly it's just a parent size mostly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah just some point that's what has happened'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it has to be open minded it's not like i want my child to be playing golf or i want to be to be playing soccer and you force the soccer you force soccer no it's taking an open minded approach'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and expose the child to as many sports as possible'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tracking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and find which one they they like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course i'm not child and the child won't be able to you know even excel in that sport or become a professional unless that child is having you know himself having interest in that sport'",
        "'speaker_3': 'fun yeah they they they're having fun'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no matter how apparently you know courses that child'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and also i think when nikki nikita was talking about the ratio that how much or what it should be so i think if you can't you can't come to a decision immediately when you enroll or when your kid starts playing something because at a very very young age let's say OK does joined into maybe two three sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe after a few years he excels in one of them so then you can't just say that OK now my kid is doing a pretty good in this swimming or something now i can only concentrate on swimming we can't do that because just to be practical or logical you can't say that every person who is good at a sport at any age of six is becoming i don't know is going and representing the country in olympics right so i think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the success rate in sport is much much lesser than the sexist read in academics because if you're good at academics you can definitely you know grow up get a job make a good living but if you neglect that and concentrate only on sports and you don't make it big so that will be a problem so that's why i say that you give it some time you definitely give it some time see how your kid is doing in your phones but don't connect the education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that that's actually really good question like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the education should not be neglected'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah come compare comparing supposed to academics that's a really good point in a way like i'm actually not very sure that you are correct here because you know many kind of athletes they become in coaches or educators you know they're going this path because they retire young'",
        "'speaker_4': 'set'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if it's you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but the thing is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like maybe teaching side they go but making it big in the sport they are starting with that is that has a very less ratio i can definitely assure you that so i'm from india and in india get is like it's a religion OK and in every street you will find at least ten kids who are joining i don't know a cricket coaching camp in summer now i don't know but you only have you only see eleven people playing for the country right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there there is something in common here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you know if you just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but and and that's the point we were saying earlier it's not about kids fulfilling the wish of their parents in a particular spot expose the child to to sports and if they really really really love a certain sport and probably that's the track they want to go you know that there is playing just for fun and being a child but but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'correct yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'buddy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and and then he's being physically capable of doing that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah yeah being physical cup but also loving it like it it it's something that is really really into your child and then you can take that child down that path but if there that she didn't want to be like two attached it to a game but they play for fun they playing for just to be with friends and then being out there but they are they are kids who will take it so serious those are the coaches and and so and they can go down that path so what what the parent need to do is to just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have still i'm saying having open mind to explore with their kids'",
        "'speaker_3': 'explore what they want and decide the ratio from the interest of the kids'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know guys'",
        "'speaker_1': 'these are all wonderful you know discussions that we we should allow kids to do what they want and what they're having fun but for example there there is a monetary part in that and you know OK i'll live in east tennessee and we have a lot of scholarships for the athletes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so for many maybe kind of like not for for the parents who know they would not be able to afford college for their kids pushing their kids towards like you know you have to play good football or you have to be good in basketball to get this scholarship and order to get into the college is actually you know a very valuable way to get into the college and then start in life'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes it actually is there here as well as a sports coat time a lot of colleges'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but that's bad that's bad because most likely the kids who are forced to that way they are not going to be good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're not going to be a good place'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what is it gonna get this scholarship and then we'll get into college'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then they're going to have their parents later because they took them down the wrong path'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i i think it's a i think it's a really valid point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i'm sure i think many parents would agree on that and say like yeah they will hate me for some time but they will have a degree and we'll have a better life than i do and like it several decades after that they they they will forgive me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and not necessarily trust me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because yeah you later on you you think you you'll see that you sacrificed your dreams because your parents forced you to go play cricket and be champion in cricket but i i i believe most kids will end up hating their parents and probably they won't succeed they you'll have you'll go to university we'll have a degree then what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then the degree doesn't even make any sense you want this so hard for you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK and about what nikita said with the spanish to get based on school so nikita i think the scholarships you get based on you know excelling in a sport the same thing is applicable for academics right you even get scholarships based on so if i think if a parent yeah so i think if a parent is not in a position to afford a good college and then i think the first thing they should do is they should make it after'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it took two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'excelling academics yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK the regional reaches a certain age they can make it clear that OK we want you we wanna send you to college but we don't think we can you know afford the whole fee and you should try for a scholarship now there are two ways you can do it you can either go to go through sports or you can either go through academics so i think that is a better way where the student or the kid at least gets a chance because the students knows his potential best see obviously i'll think that mike it is the best right but the kid is the one who's gonna sit in the exam or maybe go to the selection committee so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the kid will be in the best position to judge his own positive potential will i be able to get this scholarship based on sports thing or based on my academy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh basically academics yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i i think that would be a viable option but i think it's a valid point and one of my cousins he plays badminton first state level and he got into college just like what you are saying he is very much interested in academics also start playing sports just added to the value and it helped him maybe stand out from the other students who got the same mac so he was able to get a seat or he was able to get into the college of his choice so what you are saying is also correct it might have worked for one person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'voice yeah yeah i think that's that's important and that start from not only in college it's not from that young age as a kid just choose what you want to do you want to play sport you want to be like athletic coach'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it might not have worked for another but i think as a parent it's better to give the options keep the options open that if you wanna go academically you can do that or if you're gonna go through sports you can do that as well because it's an option then there's nothing wrong when utilizing is what i think but it should be the students choice not the parents force that's what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but do you know what you want to do at that age'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no no you don't have to say it with your words it kids say it with their actions you you take them to swimming and they're dragging their feet like ohh my god it's just another swimming but you take them to soccer they excited that's the message'",
        "'speaker_2': 'second'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's just like you have company you know open to what the kid wants to do right you have to be open to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah they don't have to say word'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it should be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe maybe'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i bet also also give the kid all the opportunities that he deserves like make make options for the kids for make the options available like if you're not liking this you can choose another sport but it's it is also not like you have to have to go to that sport it's like it's OK if you're not liking the sport'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm skype'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so don't force it you have to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm not yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like let's try yeah let's keep let's go just go let maybe like on a trial basis and i think like what you're saying that did i know when i was that age no i didn't but i'm happy that my my kids sorry my parents introduced me to music they introduced me to chess they introduced me to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly so first step had to be from the parents only because our kid will never know like i want to go to that club or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry i didn't yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly so if i'm not interested there's no way i can make a choice right so if i'm to decide whether i'm gonna go forward in this or not the first point is somebody has to introduce it to me so i know when the kids are very young they may be reluctant to get into some sports but as a parent like my parents gave me really good i don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i like a big put it to me in a really interesting way that you know all your friends will be there maybe you know you can spend extra time with your friends and maybe after you come back from the game i'll make your favorite dish or whatever you want to have something like that so you know they try their best to make me ready at least to try something after that it was my charge you know after a certain time it was my choice whether to continue or not but usually it was like a summer camp whenever the summer or spring break'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's coming my parents mostly tried me to get occupied in some of the other kind of activity and after two three years i think once you reach a certain age even the kids can tell you OK mom i like this and i don't like this so you know at least in that it's good to introduce them to different things but not the type forcing by cleverly putting them in front of it just like my parents did they were very clever about introducing me to stuff like you can't you can call it borderline bribing but if it works with the kid'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and he doesn't feel forced then i think it's good i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah the that's that's a good approach too'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it it's something should be there to make the kid feel interested or something because you know kids are ultimately like OK if i do this what will i get because they have they do totally be in that attitude at a young gate so i think the parents should make use of it to turn them towards something that might help them in the personal development may be sports music dance anything anything to keep them occupied physically or mentally so i think that's a very good idea to start with the kids at a very young age'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you know there are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good sigil say something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so say say joe what have you taken out of this conversation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i think uh from this conversation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my point would be like it's definitely important for a kid to get involved in some kind of sport along with academics it's not the ratio has to be there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so sometimes the kid can be you know a very interested himself in sports sometimes a parent needs to introduce a kid to the sport but then there are other titans of kids as well who have very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh youth social anxiety so for such kids we have to give them the option OK if you don't want to get out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and that may help them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we are there to support you you have different ways to grow your personality and make those choices available for kids in the form of some other competition or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'academics kind of thing so that the kid doesn't remain you know introvert and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh aloof for two of his lifetime so parents has to you know give some kind of push to such kids as well even though not in teams sports or individual sports but other kind of arts and activities like that so that it could evolve'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it seems like that's a wonderful way to rub'",
        "'speaker_1': 'up this conversation and'",
