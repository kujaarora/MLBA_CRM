        "'speaker_4': 'i in the cold panic let me tell you that they have done a phenomenal job they were like they were not even a single'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but available in there and everyone was asking for the government because the government have all the facilities i can tell you that like i i let me just tell you one example there is this vaccination OK the vaccination is produced in a single place the government has the biggest refrigeration stability all across the country even toilet operators can't mind their things because the government is taking care of all the vaccination how the vaccinations is successful like you have successfully like five billion people has been given the vaccine how because the government'",
        "'speaker_1': 'five'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then initiative they protrude everything they transported everything and everyone got vaccinated if this has been in private hands like the pandemic would have spread like phenomenally OK the government took the initiative that's why universal healthcare is important like the government takes the basic amenities into their hand and ensure that everyone gets that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do i don't quite i don't quite see that vaccine and one instance is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't think that anybody i don't think any country has a perfect system yet but that doesn't mean that it's not doable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or just because it hasn't been done yet doesn't mean that it cannot be done'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK it can be done but it's just that i don't want to hold the system'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on the government it should be privatized what i'm trying to say here is that you have if you look at some of the places there are coverages that are being provided by like you said medicaid right medicaid or medicare is being provided by the US curve'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and each of the states here in the US'",
        "'speaker_2': 'also provides a way of taking if you if you are below if you're below sixty five you can still get those right build a system which kind of gives you that thing where you work towards it rather than take it from twenty percent and make it free for the others'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what if you can't work for it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those who need it most can't work for it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but those exceptions are the ones who need it the most'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that most the thing is that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_2': 'something for eighty percent let the eighty percent pay for the twenty percent why not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK OK that is there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tell me that one'",

        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK there is one thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that doesn't really make sense financially though'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK help should not depend on wealth there is just one principle health should not depend on wealth OK universal health care is achieved that when everyone deserves the minimum healthcare without suffering any financial things OK so they need to have a minimum basic level across the country for everyone OK like right now what the vaccines are doing everyone the child 's are vaccinated OK there are many diseases who have vanished from the world OK because the vaccinations are tied throughout the country for everyone OK if it was not for everyone that those videos would not have one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK someone would have still carrying them OK every country has like right now there was small box or something and i found done is having those why because because the governments took initiatives into their hands'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're two kind of every countries government to consider there were a ton of aggregation drives and right now no one does that kind of a disease every country 's birth rate is right now growing exponentially growing good because they are taking care of the children and vaccinations and all the other things so good health program is a must'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what has birth rate got to do with vaccinations'",

        "'speaker_2': 'fertility is yeah so it's still high'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's i sorry my mistake child birth rate like child mortality rate mortality rate OK it was very higher nowadays it's very low if you see in the fifties it was i think twenty thirty percent OK nowadays what like zero point two percent or something OK in front'",
        "'speaker_4': 'dying rate OK it was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'particularly because the health initiative was taken up everyone has gold health everyone has good amount of vaccines everyone is getting treated somewhere there is'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah this is it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that is not economically viable at this point of time again i come back to the same point it is not economically viable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know economically viable means a whole lot less to me than people 's lives'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK like the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'look what's what's happened to your social security are you able to pay for them ten years from now or do you just want to live in the present and forget about the future'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well that they would you know kind of stop'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like there are countries where these things are very much see you can tax people more if they are not if they're system is robust let me let us say take it take it out of the utopian society if the system is robust'",
        "'speaker_3': 'taking that for other things but that's a whole different issue'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not even'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not even a matter of needing to tax people more it's actually getting corporations and people who have a lot of money to actually pay the taxes they're supposed to tax rather than getting subsidies and finding all the loopholes and all these other things if they actually took the taxes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is totally wrong'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that they're supposed to take then we would have the money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes that is totally true that is that is one of the strongest points OK so that we we have the money in our hand OK instead of cup politicians owning the money we can invest those money into a good program OK particularly where a person everyone wins you can see take care of that in scandinavian countries take they have the highest everything like on the all the matrices they are on the higher denmark sweden other things OK they have a very good system OK like no one needs to go outside everyone has the same coverage and there is like i don't think there is a like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'any big privatization private companies providing medical services all the system is universally acceptable every in those countries and they are one of the highest quality of living countries right now in the world'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah there's there's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i still come back to the economic viability and i don't know how much of it you can really tax given the tax codes that we have today there's always ways and means around it and why would anyone want to give it why would i want to give my money away to treat someone else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that's the point why don't we just stop those ways around it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no no no this is this see this country is based on the basic premise that it's a free market'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i and feel do whatever i want to do you're taking that away you're making me something which i'm not'",
