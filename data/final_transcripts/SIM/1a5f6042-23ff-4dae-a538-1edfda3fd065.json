        "'speaker_1': 'well but but why do you think there are not that many people kind of lobbying for the healthcare because it seems you know most large you know portion of united american population would benefit a lot from the you know universal healthcare but at the same time like you don't accept the bernie sanders and couple of the more like socialist type of the democrats nobody actually goes and you know promoting this idea'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but why do you think it's not happening'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i call it propaganda but i mean so much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'put out there i mean i mean you know when anybody even if you've been in the US a little bit you can you'll see the rhetoric about ohh yeah the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well there is a horrible ESS board called socialism and you know if you've been called like that that's pretty much it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah but they but they i mean this is what we we you know we don't live in a socialist state here and you see you know how how wealthy germany is in in terms of the industry standards and stuff like that so i i really don't get that and we're not the only one i mean look at other countries like sweden norway and so forth france i mean they're they're all big powerful countries and and of course there are issues there is a lot of complaints and stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but in in total we have a good running system here and and i mean of course it may maybe the the system and the health system or the the the the doctor and the science and so forth in the united states is leading in the world that's that's true but at what cost and you you know you have to come overcome a certain point where it's like it's not just just not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the sustainable anymore i i really don't get that i really don't get that and i think i mean how how does how do people voting for donald trump'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not not care about that i think i i sometimes i have the feeling they care more about the the freedom of where of of of wearing guns then about their own health system and stuff like that i don't really get that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well part of it is is because the health care is not really on the ballot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'part of it part of his money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'components will not really present in a good like no we should concentrate on the medicare for all for example yeah they they are not really for that so they are not kind of pushing this idea at the same time but but did you i have a question to you like since you live in a country with both you know state healthcare and the the private healthcare why do you think the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'private yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'private healthcare is still there like why why is it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it's i think the the the reason is because we had an obligatory health insurance because it was well itary until two thousand nine or ten so not too long ago it was the same you know when you were when you were entrepreneurial you were independent you could decide whether you have a health insurance or not and then it was legally binding to to have a health insurance and i think it was a compromise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so then say OK at least you can have the choice you if you earn a certain amount of money you have to i think you have to you have to earn about more than fifty thousand euros or dollars or something like that per year to to qualify for the private'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's the compromising and i think it's a lobby thing as well but i'm pretty sure that we are going to see it go even though yeah there will be a lot of resistance but from my point of view but we have a completely different situation here in germany as well i mean you you you know we don't see because you mentioned it before we do not have unemployment we we need people here in germany come over to germany work in germany because we're running out of of of of people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and qualified people this is a system here and the the problem here more than than anything else and but but the the question why it is there i think it is the the the industry the hospitals doctors and so forth less so the insurance companies and and the and the pharmaceutical industry and i also believe that i looked at the figures we had twenty years ago thirty years ago'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'over one thousand insured health insurance companies in germany can you believe that over one thousand now we're down to ninety'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and still ninety insurance companies are way too much to run an effective and efficient system i from a from an economic point of view there should be three four big ones competing with each other because otherwise every one of these insurance companies do have their own'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i always they have their own flag they have their own advertising they have their own you know big big big salaries they have their board of executives and so forth so it's cost a lot of money and there's a lot of prestige behind it and that is definitely not necessary you can run an efficient online system nowadays like every other big insurance companies would do it as well so from my point point of view there should be three four five big companies competing each other with the services so you have the choice'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and there is a competition between the systems but not ninety and not and or not one thousand as it was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ten twenty years ago so i think to cut it short here i i think we we will still live for reasonable amount of time with the private insurance system but not for that much longer i i strongly believe in that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and it it just'",

        "'speaker_4': 'they're trying to privatize the whole system potentially go towards where the united states is now the NHS is a system that was created'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it's something that the british people are very very proud of it is a decent system if you get pretty seriously sick'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm you are relatively speaking looked after'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you do have to wait quite some time for certain types of treatments but if i need to go to the doctor in thirty four minutes for thirty forty minutes from now i'll i'll be out a doctor even if it's a care doc i might wait up to i might have to wait a couple of hours but i'll be there yeah if if my daughter needs something'",

        "'speaker_4': 'uh would be i don't know seventy eight euros for the medication that you need i mean a quick maths on that let's call it eighty and you need eight things that would be six hundred and forty call it pounds right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'll actually pay a fat payment of nine pounds per item so eight by that you'll pay seventy two pounds for potentially six hundred and forty quid worth of'",
