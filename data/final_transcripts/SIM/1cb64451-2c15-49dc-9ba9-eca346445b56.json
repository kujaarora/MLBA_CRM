        "'speaker_3': 'OK well i think it should be allowed as long as the social media profiles are not private if they're set on private i think it's your own information is your own right and i don't think another person should have a right to access that specifically so i think as long as it's open and everybody can access it out there why should your employer not also be able to access it but if as long as the private no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i agree like some people can it really tell it really shows how'",

        "'speaker_4': 'but that's that's the thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i agree with that i'm just going to say that they shouldn't be able to look at the profiles but i do believe that once they look at a profile they should already be in the process of hiring that person i believe that once they look at the profile they are putting themselves in a place of being able to discriminate and i don't believe that that should be allowed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm they should not be able to look at the employees it says future employees so in terms of actually looking at a profile before they are employed i do not believe that they should be allowed to do that if you if they would like to get to know the employee that they just hired'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then yes go for that but that that would that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no because too many states are at will states and they can fire them for anything that they find on there'",

        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then they look at it at the social media profile and finds out that he's gay he can be fired now they're not going to say they're firing them because he's gay but they're going to come up with all kinds of other what other reasons'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then let me let'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then let me ask you something if you put your social media profile on a public right the whole world can basically access that why shouldn't you employer be excluded like everybody can access it but not your employers do you like the only person in the world who cannot access this i mean if you're if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well if we put something'",

        "'speaker_2': 'you know so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i what what what i i think what i am what i'm an actor is talking about is that an employer has the ability to watch at your public profile they should in my opinion never be able to watch your private profile because that's your private life right'",

        "'speaker_2': 'exactly if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a lot of employers are telling people now we need to be able to see this so do you guys think that that's OK for them to be able to say as a requirement for your job we need to be able to look at this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it depends'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it depends whether what if they work for a government agency then probably let's be like if you work like animal like the FBI or the or the CIA or some some like'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean if there's security clearances that's a whole different you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but they know anything they know everything about your life anyway so a social media profile is nothing to them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean god they can go back to your kindergarten teachers you know with that one so that that's a whole kind of a different thing but i'm talking about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohhh alright'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think charlie'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or if you work for a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we're back you worked with big like that or financial firm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm just talking about like kind of a regular professional job'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK with for those then no unless it's public if it's private no but if you work for like i don't know a big financial firm and you're dealing with millions and millions of dollars it's probably a good idea to make sure to fully you know to fully understand who you're hiring and if they're not a trustworthy person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i disagree with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i think that the person a person'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you don't fully understand who you're hiring you need to know they know how to take care of money that's it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you end up and a person as person privacy should be going over money i think it's more important unless like you said you have some kind of responsibility i think kindergarten teacher also is like a a good point of that i think if you want that job there comes a certain responsibility with that job and a certain trust that is not something that needs that can be built that needs to be there from the start and i think you should be allowed to check a kindergarten teacher social media profile yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they're trustworthy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so but like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you have a kindergarten teacher that has just a sailor 's mouth OK can't say a simple sentence without cussing unless of course she's around the kids at school and then she's doesn't say anything at all inappropriate but on her facebook profile she's dropping F bombs all over the place well parenting principles might not like that but is that in any way at all affecting how she does her job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but to be honest i think i i think most people are doing that and they're just not showing it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no that's her being yourself'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm i don't think that that would that would be something that i would say it's inappropriate to be able to teach children if you do a it's always it's always something different i think it's always different well you need to set guidelines for ethical guidelines without right so i think it's always different if you do something in public or if you're fine with doing something if you're fine doing something in public or if you're doing something private'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you may not but people might'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's a problem is that here in the states most states are in at will state so that means that my job if i had one could come to me today and say you're fired and if i ask him why he says because i said so and they don't have to give me a reason and that's perfectly legal and unless i can somehow prove with solid evidence that they fired me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for some illegal reason then i might have luck'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that's why i'm that that's why i'm kind of really hesitant to let anybody to say it's OK for any employers to look at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm the social media profiles because it's way too easy for them to come up with some reason'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why they should fire that person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah yeah i see your point that's a good point to be honest so you basically they don't on a personal level like something that they see but it would not be a reason to be able to fire you but then they're searching for something that they could fire you for but it would be another reason'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah and i think i think especially with things like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know with with uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know say you put on there that you've had an abortion you know you're because you don't see any reason why you shouldn't let your catholic employer doesn't like that you know or like i said you know that the LGBT thing you know if if you're not out at work because of the conservativeness of your employer that can be a big issue too'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that couldn't be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just i don't think we need to give employers kind of anymore ammunition than they already have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but how would you enforce that there's no way you can really stop them and poise from checking someone out online profile especially if it's public if it's public anyone can check it and just look'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that's up to the employee to keep it to not make it public'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah private yeah so it's up to the employee because people are always gonna check employers are probably gonna check so it's up to the employee to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they have it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to post'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly it's not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'clients to do is put everything on lockdown every social media profile you have like a doubt'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you can't exactly trust employers to always do the right thing you kind of have to take your own initiative and just protect yourself'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as far as i'm concerned you can kind of trust them not to do the right thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so you need to protect yourself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i kind of feel also like social media is kind of like a responsibility that we're kind of also learning because when it everything came out of in the last ten years it was just like ohh yes let's post everything and i just you know let's be like free and everything and now people realize OK there's consequences to what you pose and there's kind of like a responsibility growing in that regard also like to be aware OK i have to be actually careful what i post'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so that's why i actually have to some say something is technically i'm considered a content creator on facebook i didn't apply for this or anything i woke up one morning and now they just let me know hey brittany you're now basically employed for facebook'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean not care'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we see that your content gets a lot of attention so at that point people that are funded by facebook'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no you're not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is no way that a a job should be able to tell you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'should be able to fire you for what you're doing at a different job if it doesn't have anything to do with them once you're a content creator on social media you're gonna be having requests like a person might say you know i want to see you do this and i wanna see you do that and just because someone else doesn't like that you did that or say that it was a competitor of your boss that sent you that request like hey i wanna see you tie your shoelaces'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm in the morning and your boss is like i had problems with them in sixth grade i didn't like that you actually answered their request and you got paid for making that content they should not be able to do any of that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well let me give you an example let's say on your social media profile is full of you hunting animals and you're applying as a a marketing director for or marketing position at a job at a vegan company'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think you're not fit for the job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i really don't i really think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean you could be unfit but the thing is is what you eat doesn't make their feces so it's like just because they might not they might go hunting because that might be a family tradition that they've had for so long and that's how they spend time with their family who's to say that they even eat that meat that's like that's faulting someone for having family traditions and that's wrong'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just stop'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but you also have to you also have to look at the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you still have to look at the social backlash if stuff like like the example question just gave if people find out someone high up in the company a vegan company was killing animals there's gonna be a lot of social backlash and that can affect their dogs but affect their investors they connect their product you know there could be a lot of backlash so i think it's a way to vet'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is why i say they need to stop putting so much investment in the actions that people and focus on who those people actually are if they're losing stocks because they're employee those hunting and they don't believe in it that means somewhere along the way they put some type of annie on the fact that their employee wasn't gonna do that and there should not be able to do that we're all on the clock around the clock we're not on the clock'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i think it's what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah because because every company has a value statement kind of part of your business plan is is called the value statement and it basically says that as a company our company believes in this this this and this and if you're a vegan company then part of that value statement is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and pretty much has to be we believe in not killing animals or something to that sort so if you have employees that are killing animals and that is contradicting your value statement and actually you can put it into contract no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'unless you're trying to help them see the values of not killing animals if you fire the person you're no better than you said that you were at the beginning because you said you value not killing animals and then you fire someone that that that kills animals that's not gonna stop the animals from being killed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no it's it's not about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because there's usually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'companies like that that would companies like that where they're value statements are really part of who their company is they're company identity like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think if you go one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then there is a contract that says you have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know you can't do certain things or you have to do certain things that uphold the values of the company and if you violate a contract then that's a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'volume'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fun'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's illegal thing you know you know what you're getting into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you go one step further let's talk greenpeace if you're an employee like say you work for greenpeace and you are they have a on a social media you're hunting lines and freaking africa you cannot tell me that that should not be something that should be considered for somebody hiring for greenpeace i mean for example greenpeace greenpeace is hugely funded by private money right so they would they would lose they could lose potentially a lot of funding except for that so it definitely do the way you you act in your private lives is also reflecting on the way you represent the company'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes that's just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those lions kill people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but again'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those lions tell people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it definitely is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'auction speak auction speak louder than words'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now idiotic when that when that employ your feel if that employee look at them and said'",
        "'speaker_2': 'again things are written down contract'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're picturing contracts so i know that if i have to sign a contract that says i can't hunt well i'm working for greenpeace if i'm a big hunter i'm not gonna sign that contract i'm not gonna go work for and here's another example though so like in the news lately there's been a lot of the carens quote calling the police on somebody 's there's a one in particular called the police on a man in central park for bird watching he was a black man'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the reason for these calls are it's it's white people seeing black people in situations they don't feel comfortable with them being in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so she got fired'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your call it for making that call'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because that that is that's kind of if she was on the clock that made the company look bad'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you had on the clock'",
        "'speaker_1': 'she was not on the clock then i don't believe that she should be fired for that what i believe should happen is if the employer saw that happen maybe they can pull miss karen to the side and say you know i know what happened the other day and this is how i see this this i'll give you an opportunity since you're my employee to let me know what your side of this is how did you see this situation that happened what was wrong what what is inside of you like what is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about what so what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's the problem with this so we can get on the same page give her a chance to speak for it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so within that can she affect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but the thing is everybody everybody knew it everybody'",
        "'speaker_2': 'she she filmed herself she herself filmed the entire interaction she filmed herself with her dog off leash and unleashed part of the park calling the police on a black man because he was bird watching and it made her uncomfortable and he didn't leave when she told him to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i think that she should be able to keep her job so she has more of her time accounted for so she doesn't have to be around those people she could be at work making money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not this before that's not what a company hires people for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no no no but there's also so much homeless and hungry people because people don't like to to be to be about their morals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but everybody everybody knew'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but see here's the thing is is big because it was such a huge deal i mean this was like worldwide one of the ones that would worldwide since it was such a big deal everybody knew who this company who this person worked for because everybody found out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so everybody went a lot of people started writing an emailing this company and saying hey what kind of people do you have working for you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and so for their own PR they fired her'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he could also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you could also argue if she's going to do that outside the work she might do it inside the work so if the company does have back employees they might they might do this to steve i don't know to to stop her doing the same thing that work that could be that could be a reason to justify paying her'",
        "'speaker_2': 'very good boy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'very good point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is a good point then that's why i say that it's important to watch your employees why they're at work not outside of work even if you but if you do see something outside of work it's OK to speak on it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's like putting myself in the position of a business owner if i were to see karen call the police on a black person just solely because they're black and she doesn't like that they're having the liberty and leisure that they are i'd have to you know bring her into my office and be like hey miss karen i'd like you to know that we're on planet earth and you in that black person decided to be at the same place at the same time that day so i want you to understand that the plans that earth had had you two people there at the same time type of people that's the same place you were at i would like to know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what made you so teed off about the situation and if i hear something in this then we have another conversation to have i don't wanna fire you for it i just kind of want to know that if i hire black employees is there gonna be a problem between you and them is this something that we have to hand now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i fired'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i find it without any discussion here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'out the back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i and i i'm also one of those people i'm very bare skinned i'm light skinned i have to i do have black parent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm parenting but i'm not dark skinned i i'm not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what most would consider black so'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i think that's kind of normal as women'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that's the problem racism is not a it's not it's not a most most racism and i'm not gonna say all most racism is not hatred it's a fear'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like they're technology'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would agree with that too i think it's just ignorance i mean in the US i mean in the US you don't have racism you have pretty much segregation it's it's not even racism anymore it's just like every'",
        "'speaker_3': 'every uh ethnicity is just living in their own bubble and they're just fighting each other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which makes it hard for a mixed person like me because they expect you to pick sides and i'm i refuse'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'should we stay on topic is they're getting up yeah so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so when it company has'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has a value statement'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in in some companies values are like you know we're gonna make a profit for our stakeholders you know and and things like that you know kind of the basic generics but if some if a company has a value statement like you mentioned green peas or a vegan company where there's gonna be particular items in there like you know we don't hunt we don't kill animals we don't do this or that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'should that give them more cause to be able to look at a close social media profile'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you're like i said it should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to make sure that somebody 's gonna uphold those values at that point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i think it i think your privacy goes above everything i think your privacy is the most important thing that you have and it should not be it should not be disrupted unless there's calls for it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i don't think they should anybody should be able to look at your social media profile unless there's calls for let's for example course with being you committed the crime of a certain degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah i i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think what's what's interesting is though'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's maybe is gonna is it already started pretty much but it's becoming more prevalent is that people are actually being dishonest with their social media profile and they're kind of like tweaking it to make yourself look into a certain way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right so i don't get the question is i think how how reliable in a few years are is your social media profile actually gonna be i see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well most people are getting paid for that now so they're actually there when they're tweaking the truth about themselves they're being asked to do these things which is the same it's employment just like when you sign up for a job and you're signing up to then conform to their rules social media is now paying people so it's the same we can't look at social media as a social justice social breakthrough now it is now a job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'out most people are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it it's not to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but even take taxes out of it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most people these people aren't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah the the vast majority of people on social media aren't getting paid for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know what's wrong with them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but what can happen what what happens is like i said i do some some career counseling it's not kind of my main thing but i do some of it and that's one of the things that i tell people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know locked down your social media profile if there are companies who absolutely have to see it and it's something you you know it's the job that you really want then here let's rework it and we will go through and we will change everything on that profile to match what that company is looking for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have another scenario say there's a say there's a a starting at there's an artist that's just starting not starting out but they they're struggling artists that's that's a massively known phrase have a struggling artist'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's applying for a position at a job and already knowing that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're going to use the funds from that job to take care of themselves pay their bills take care of their home and hoping that they make enough to actually buy equipment for their own artistry so they can do their own thing with that also you have to keep in mind that if you have a certain type of artist for instance for me i might decide to advocate for people with depression some of my art isn't gonna be for people that don't have problems with depression i might draw a picture i might talk to someone and they're like every single day when i wake up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that feels like i'm drowning in a lake i can't breathe it feels like there's bubbles coming out of my nose i might draw a picture of someone drowning in a lake now my employer might be like that's disturbing i didn't like that you did that you're fired when all i was actually doing was advocating for someone else i drew a picture of it because i'm an artist and it actually helped them tremendously and that only brings it back to one person that that actually ends up not caring about people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but to me the whole concept is strange because he in germany it's illegal that an employer looks at your private social media profile because as i said like we yeah yeah we we we had some privacy laws coming through three years five years and seven years ago which kind of puts your own private data not just do social media profile but even your private data and the internet above everything else and if anybody wants to access this for example if you go into your new site and somebody wants to look at your cookies you need to give consent for it and if you don't it's illegal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they actually prosecuting that and for social media profile if it's on private and an employer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ask you to accept it you can sue them U M and uh you get money for it and yeah it's it's because i mean it's that's in my opinion that's how it should be so i am i don't understand why you and you also have this this big problem where they don't do the same privacy laws that we have here in in germany because it it works really well and i think everybody 's comfortable with that also i mean the employer cancel said can look at your public social media profile but they should never be allowed to look at your private social media profile'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so i think it goes on to the thing though are you making it public or private cause if you make your social media private public i think you just have to deal with the consequences of that if we're being brutally honest if you if you don't want to deal with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean i think at that point that's on you yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just yeah i know it's on your you just need to make a private thing about in that scenario just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct but if i make a forum about if i make a forum dedicated to people that have a certain issue and i'm gonna just bring it back to depression again outside of work so i'm at work all day i haven't nine to five at nine AM i'm i'm in the building at five five PM five thirty i'm out of the building if i'm posting at six thirty PM some something on my profile and i have a specific amount of friends and put it on private me posting a forum to branch out and get help for those people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'isn't going to do me any good so having my profile on private is actually harming other people because they're still being ignored and that's where ignorance comes in versus if i have it on public it can be shared abundantly and and other people can and can chime in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hey but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then that's that's just a risk that you take then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know i'm in that it's it's just that simple everything has its cost'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if you know that this is important to you to to have this forum and and to have everything out there and open then you know that you're taking the risk of of any potential employer seeing that and not liking it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would just rather have an open forum to where people can feel comfortable and and have someone to come to you about those things versus having open caskets of these people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i get i get that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but if an employer has a problem with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they were able to see it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know we we can't keep we we can't make our our profiles open and say anybody can look at them except an employer you know there's no way to make them not look at it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the funny thing is we have kind of like the different problem here we have the we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're actually is that's the thing umm there is a place on there where you go into and it says anyone could look at except that's where employers are supposed to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a page for their company they're not supposed to be sending hey can they're not supposed to be saying things like they know that like you have a main page for your company if an employer if the employee decides to have the employee not see it should be very easy to go in and just put the employers page on except like do not let this page see it but then you have employers that are gonna try to bring other employees and and say hey go look at that page because i'm not allowed to and that's where they come up with things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'making it illegal because it's wrong'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's one you can do to combat that realistically like how are you gonna get around that people just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like cream'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so not not all employers not all companies do have a company page and we have to remember that behind every company is people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'accountability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well if they are so tied down on being able to hold people accountable for what their social media page is maybe they should get one for their company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but they don't have to i mean that's it there's there's never been anything saying that a company has to have one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this can be very catastrophic in a bad way but yeah sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean if if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just you know i think that's all those things people need to take'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they kind of need to understand what the consequences are what the real world consequences are not what what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for instance one time i thought i got some backlash on there and and like i said i'm a content creator on there so i'm i have to be accountable for things i put on there facebook itself won't let me put things on there it finds an appropriate so i don't wanna hear that from an employer i can't if i put something that facebook finds unappropriate on there and i mean the the least inappropriate i'm gonna tell you the story about it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it's the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i i i can't access my my facebook which then means i can't keep in touch with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the the people that i keep in touch with what that be family friends that are across the country or anything as such i can't do it but there was a time where there was a post made and i even tried to argue it with them but they didn't have it i still got my page suspended there was a post that came across my news feed and mind you i have it set to personalized stuff so anything that's my news feed i already know i'm being tracked for that i signed up for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there was a post that said something about this is for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'black people only and i made a i commented it and i was like i don't know why i'm seeing this because every time i post on this dark skinned white people aren't allowed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they faulted me for that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well you know you're human you also should be allowed to to make a mistake sometimes you're not you don't need you can't think about everything you're doing all the time so i think that's a problem not just with social media but with the internet in general that everybody expects you to be to be completely perfect and they just judge every single thing of you and that's that's just something that's just wrong with it to be honest on ethical point of view'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i didn't understand it because the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'so i couldn't even make money on there during that suspension time because someone had a problem with me calling myself'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it no it wasn't that's that's the thing it wasn't it wasn't someone what it is is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no ma'am they don't know it was someone because they came with a message like they literally they they contacted you a person contact you and talk to you about this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's machine center'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no it's it's a machine sensor first'",

        "'speaker_2': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it can happen by being reported but it can also it can also happen just because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the facebook machine learning basically sees certain keywords and they can do it that way too kevin automatic thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's what i'm saying that's all part of the that that's all part of the AI that's what we're programming things to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think certain tops they're just more sensitive so i'm thinking tops you do like race abortion politics all those probably are probably looked at more and probably easier to flag so if you if you if you could just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah there's certain things and you know when they have'",

        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'because they like being black and i'm like you guys are not understanding this makes me twitch like every time you guys say forget her i start to go numb i'm not pairing up with you on that'",
