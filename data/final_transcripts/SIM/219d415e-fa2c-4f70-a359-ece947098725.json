        "'speaker_1': 'you do politics for the sake of doing politics it's not you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that that's right it's a sport in itself but that's the thing thorsten uh so germany and elshad germany has a kind of just really abandoned the two sides of that was so long ago for you guys right like i'm talking about the eighties so we just need the scorpions to solve our problems julie let's get yourself a little bit of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i usually dominate the conversation but i've been trying to be too polite'",

        "'speaker_3': 'so what were you what were you wanting me to say about a small business owner'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah anything any other info you have we have a second part of the question just to keep remind us here and i have to look at it again does minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of their employees let's go with that start'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i think it i think it does here's an example so we have two cities mattoon and charleston which are you know within three miles of each other and they both have a walmart and the one walmart this is crazy i don't know how they do this they raised their minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour and charleston still has theirs at thirteen dollars an hour so the people in charleston were transferring to matt tune and they stopped that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they didn't allow him to do that anymore which caused a lot of disgruntled employees in charleston and mattoon the people that were making fifteen dollars an hour now they had it they had to just suck it up and do whatever they were told because they had this money you know as an incentive and they didn't have the freedom that they had when they were making twelve dollars an hour or thirteen dollars an hour so that's just right here in our community that you can see those differences'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm and a lot of the bigger factories are UM advertising like you know we're gonna pay twenty five dollars an hour because they can't get anyone to come work there and then like elshad was saying they get people get over there and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now this factory feels like they can demand all these extra things of people because they are offering them such a big wage so it it is problematic for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well here in the US we have our uh minimum wage jobs and that can be also uh the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people can also stretch themselves to their limits at that minimum wage job so i kind of think that at times uh from what we see on our side a minimum wage job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can be a little bit difficult and you're kind of wondering why can't i get paid more but that for me that was a long time ago when i worked those types of jobs but i still feel for the people that do work these types of jobs because it really doesn't seem fair whence we considered the corporation that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'paying them i mean what a dollar increase be that that uh people deserve a a live living wage but the arguments against these are that it will change the cost of living'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh for area and you said that you've seen that in your state'",
        "'speaker_3': 'absolutely things are so uh the prices are so inflated compared to the other states around us that have you know just kind of maintained now in indiana there's still you know i said making seven dollars and twenty five cents which is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is wrong as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and their people are suffering and people are trying to what you know raise children in UM take care of their families and you know like the price is on amazon are not different from for them than they are for us here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the those types of things are very similar and the cost of living is going up but their wages are staying staying low i think it's really interesting what thorsten and elshad were pointing out i hadn't thought about how different our country is than'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm you know in europe for example because we do have those huge discrepancies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'man'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what about one thing that's similar is at the minimum wage i guess is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not necessarily as social tool but it's some sort of construct for the uh it's a wage for like almost it is sort of a universal wage i haven't seen it go under seven point twenty five in our in america do you know if it ever goes below that because there's like a website with a sliding scale'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that shows uh the state every states uh minimum wage and what would happen if you increase it a little bit it's it's an interesting site but it's it's not lower than like five dollars or seven twenty five right and last time i checked'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well if you're if you make tips then they can pay you less and i think it's like five dollars or something but then you have to be able to make the amount of tips make that up in tips or something so i don't know that's a whole nother issue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh that's right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think i'm i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that is but at a minimum wage i think is a good idea for workers in general but UM elshad or let's see so elshad 's point was no dorson was no julie had a mixed opinion and yeah we're still researching these things out what about you guys what do you think about the future do you think that in the future'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a yeah of course uh the minimum wage could be like better if the people get like not the lowest one for example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh black as you mentioned uh if if we if we use the same amazon like it doesn't make sense that you get three dollars per hour like i get fifteen dollars per hour then it is not fair it it you the that is the the there is a need for kind of affair regulation for that but whenever we struggle or then we cannot say that ohh yeah OK let's go and revise the the minimum wage it will not work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it will not benefit us either for the thing is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah as i mentioned before it never ever in the history of the economy benefited people it it had always it had more cons than pros when the minimum wage went up that's the thing that's why we need just a good regulation for that like i think europe is quite good at that like compared to like as you talked a lot about the USA example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'man'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it it is different here and i think like it it is it it is a controlled better it also we had some states like for example in the in in munich or in in fact would like also the like there are more skilled workers like the people live there there are a lot of people who live there or something and i live in in in the region that it's not dense the populated it's very low population here and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that it is very different to those kind of regions but still we have the same regulations that as a minimum because we use the same online store we use the same stores around the country so it has to be this way i believe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright so uh julie do you think that uh in the future uh maybe states will be more prepared or an economy may be more prepared for a wage increase like the minimum wage increase'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh lord i hope so because it's it's so it's there's such a disparity right now and i i think we're really in trouble our our economy is over inflated here in illinois and you know when i travel to indiana and see the things and you know we do travel we're gonna be in florida in a few weeks and i'm gonna be going you know different states in the next few months you see that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the things that are so different and the way people live and the poverty UM when people are trying to make a wage and they're still making seven twenty five and i really hope that we can work it out where there's a little bit more consistency here in the US because our economy is out of control'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wait wait'",
