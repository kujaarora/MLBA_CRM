        "'speaker_3': 'i don't think it shouldn't be increased nationally only because in some state in some states like you're like i say montana and states like that they don't have the workforce that you have over here in like washington or california or something like that so then it should be different but we should have a minimum fleet like like for job was saying that we have to have something where people can live you know people can't live i'm an educator right and so we worked with disadvantaged youth i used to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we had we sat down what the what it cost per month to live and this was years ago like say maybe ten dollars an hour still at today's wages these these kids they they can't live they they think that everything is free because they they've got all these government programs that help supplement'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the like like health care cost and you know bus passes and stuff like that these kids just think that all that comes free and it doesn't you know and so when you look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it pays from the taxes yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can't protect them when you look at it this is the money that you're bringing in you're not gonna have cable you're not gonna have this you can just barely eat you know and so there should be some type of minimum wage so that just like the it's minimum wage is not a wage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to live on i mean that's that's the big'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i totally agree with you yeah you know they shouldn't be a national standard actually it it has to be looked upon the local factors of the states you know some state might require less minimum wage you know the the bars should be less and in the for example a person would living in new york'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would not be able to live on the same prices of texas or some other state i think i'm not uh i'm not staying there but as per my information this rates are way higher in some area like california and all the rates are very above and then some in some states it's very low in the same same case in our in our country as well rates in delhi'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our way high and in mumbai are way high but rates in the eastern part or some northern northern like uh punjab india punjab where their prices are very less hence you know they can but it requires a lot yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is also very nice'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good she's you can jump in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but when we talk about increase the minimum wage would hurt the economy of our count country small businesses are huge loss of jobs and it would increase the competition and i thought increases it it will cost increases the cost of living deducing opportunity of inexperienced worker of fresher or college graduated personal go for an interview and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'didn't get any because they are fresher they don't have any experience so when they have no experience they fire because they have no experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they suffer from my employment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i mean it sounds like it'd be definitely be harder for younger people where you are at but then what would that do if if you don't increase it or if then what would it do for people that are more established in their career or that have family more cost would that that make it harder for them to get a good paying job if all wages aren't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'raised because of the minimum wage has been increased'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually that's the see i i got i got your point that you know having less images would help the unskilled labor get jobs but you know that that's that can be curbed by you know at least you know if a person is being told that getting this skill will help you increase your wage and getting that skill will not will affect you monetary in a very you know it won't act as a burden monetarily'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the companies can do that companies do trains people in their work culture for example i have seen many people who work for google have not done any computer science or bachelors or masters they have just done boot camps and some online courses and they were able to crack the job so in other many it sectors i have seen that this that people just from learning from internet have cracked the job and they're working on those so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is something which you can be taught you know to rural areas of of of our country if you're talking about and that sense so it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'should be clear that even if you are unskilled labor you can start with your your basic living expenses would be covered and you just have to think about getting more skills and you know you can increase your prices from here so i i would say like even if you're unskilled it doesn't mean that you need to be paid less that you can't sustain your life it should be enough to have a little'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i babysit feeling the motivation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a kind'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of doing bad work or high work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you know that that would do increase uh after you get into incorporate for example a person who would be who had at least have eighteen thousand'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and rupees and their bank account and they are just start just starting out or around eighteen to nineteen years old person and he sees that that i at least my expenses are paid off i can live on this amount and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all the starting point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he will think about then educating himself so but if he'll he'll he will be paying you know getting around seven to six thousand or ten thousand a month and then his mind will not be on educating himself he would be thinking on how i can increase my money you know so he'll resort to some other methods you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that's my argument that if if if you're given if you're being paid just for sustaining your life not luxury not luxury i'm not i'm not talking about the luxury aspect just sustaining life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a person would think about more on the educating aspect than in you know in improving them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and another another another just you know an argument that people make you know people that have gotten above that minimum wage you always here especially in the US that i know i don't want the minimum wage increase because that makes my job less valuable my voice thought personally it's just gonna raise all wages and raise the minimum wage then yeah the assistant manager is gonna get a higher pay like it's gonna naturally adjust itself but yeah what do you guys think about that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are you know what you know what they're doing now they're doing they're making kids i like i know some kids that work for us and ski resort and they're making they got rid of all the managers and everything they call it now they call it a lead they pay them what twenty cents thirty cents more an hour and they're the boss and then you got these other ones it's ridiculous what they're how they're how they're getting around that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the when i was in high school there was a i had a friend he was an assistant manager at the goes the dollar general or something so you have like a a seventeen year old as an assistant manager but there's still like making twenty five cents above above minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'being managers yeah being manager'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly and so that's what companies are going doing now with our lower with the with the lower wage with it's fifteen with the with the middleman wage i mean they don't wanna pay they don't wanna pay benefits they don't wanna give you any kind of share compensation for what you do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just want to give you designations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you're not going to get an education'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i think the goal would be to have fewer minimum wage jobs and i know i saw it just a statistic before back you know before covid when they were really pushing for fifteen dollars an hour and they said forty percent of the jobs in the country are under fifteen dollars an hour so that's that's a significant it's not one of those things where if you just work harder you don't have to be a minimum wage well forty percent of the country it has to be on low wage the way we have it set up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you know a bunch of that forty percent are women and minorities that are working those jobs so you know they don't really they don't really count they don't really matter because they will eventually pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get to where everybody else is you know and that's what we have a lot of migrant workers to the west of us and the thing was that we were always told is to work hard while working hard at minimum wage and go and get you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in about a sore back you know that's why that's all it is anymore you know they they want you to to believe in this myth but and that's all it is it's a myth you know you you're not you're not gonna pick anything'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely yeah true true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think there's a certain percentage that are always gonna have to be at the minimum wage they that's what would be the argument you need to have them at least have a living wage and i'm guessing guys that that's similar in india there's a lot of minimum wage jobs there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i see so that point mentioned by the it was very valid like this is a myth that if you work more you work more hard you're you'll earn more because if that is true many people labor'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is the people who work on the labor construction side would be you know they would be the richest richest people in this earth that's not true exactly so i totally agree with you on that that it this is kind of an ecosystem that these companies these corporates have built that that makes you think of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know that you are not that good and hence that's why you're we are paying you less but when it comes down to these managers you know giving them titles of assistant manager regional manager and paying them just maybe a buck or two more for just that title so that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the title yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you don't you know yeah you know it's it's it's it's more like a honey dropping that i'm you know showing a person would show off that i'm a manager but how much they're making you know it also comes down through the education like aspect for example this college education a person would be getting in college education and getting getting less money than a person who would be working in an organization for five to six years in maybe a diploma course so you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly and yeah i i worked in manufacturing for twenty two years OK a lot of the people that i worked with out at this aluminum plant they came to kaiser because their teachers i'm a i'm a turned into a teacher later on but they they were teachers out there at kaiser working alongside with us because the the wage for a teacher was not comparable to what we were making out there we're making good money and then you know in two thousand i decided to change careers and go into education'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true true true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so see this this you know is it the this argument of the jobs will become less this just goes out of the window like obviously there are many jobs to be done a person who is on the line and manufacturing industry is that important then a teacher who is teaching in a school and that is important in comparison to other jobs as well everyone is an integral part if any part goes down'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hey'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i took a i took the twenty thousand dollar i took a twenty thousand dollar pay cut you know to become a teacher because i was making like i'm making pretty good money but i went into education and like but i i didn't go into it for the money but the the teacher should be paid more that's different totally different subject topic yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but anyway'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can you come baby still low too low in some areas and we can say minimum wages can have an adverse employment effect by reducing the demand for workers whose wages have increased this can occur an employee substitute other input for the low wage label whose values have increased i'm nineteen years old and then and then my age it's hard to find a perfect job for a girl'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'new'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but i think that there's definitely yeah it's it's not a simple fix and it's like people just like hey let's just jump to the wage up to this big amount i think it needs to be a kind of a gradual thing and i think it i think it should be tied to inflation somehow tied to cost of living and it should like every few years it should automatically go up it doesn't make any sense not to when cost of living is going up but yeah there's definitely factors it might be different industries you have to look at and especially you know texas'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we have a a lot of you know the the migrant workers and those jobs like yeah you're not gonna get anybody'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're not gonna get it really any american citizens that wanna do those jobs out in the fields you know picking fruit or whatever all day so you know i had to there's definitely different factors in but those you can't pay somebody fifteen twenty dollars an hour'",
        "'speaker_4': 'less'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because otherwise the cost would shoot up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also because you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but maybe they should go into some different kind of compensation then you know minimum wage plus some kind of different compensation for those type of jobs you know because you're not you're you're not gonna let you can't live if you have a time if you have children and then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then you wanna live in a house by yourself and maybe that's why so many people you know live together you have so many people living together because they're all making minimum wage which is a good way to go to start off'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
