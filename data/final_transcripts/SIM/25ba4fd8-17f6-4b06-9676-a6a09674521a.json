        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to to to be to be an engineer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i need it to be operated by someone do you think someone would college and someone who has the really good work experience but doesn't have a a college degree like who who will you choose'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it depends it really is is a matter of OK if i'm looking at the latest three D printer that can print in titanium or in other metals than an engineer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no if we we are assuming that candidate who doesn't have a degree knows that printer whichever the printer is is not a new printer to that person'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'without'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no it's not about your assumption we have resume like we have CV for these two people we have this person with a college degree and i have a resume for this person with no college degree but he or she has worked with that kind of a printer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well then i take the guy with your experience of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then i take the guy with the experience of course but when i'm talking about a job for example in scientific research'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for for ten years'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when i need somebody to find the best chemical composition for the next greatest battery system then i'm probably better off with a new graduate than with a guy who's been working in lithium ion and nothing else'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but i don't think that it's to colleges college i would say education or what like the the things that you mentioned they are where they where they very specific fields and it it would requires even i would say like a PHD'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that's exactly what a good university will do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'HDD about yeah but the thing is that we are not talking about PHD degree or like a higher education it's just we're talking about the mistaken college they like but you mentioned that chemical things or the other way specific scientific things like they are related to very deep professions like with someone with the the prof degree or like PHD degree where i would say that the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i guess that's the first thing we have to do is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know the thing is the thing is is we are we are you know we we want like a black and white so it's either college degree or job experience we we don't have something in the middle like it depends we know it depends but that's why we took side like everyone take your side which one do you feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'USA can explain us what's college'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or or or how about a PHD'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that makes sense'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in one from USA or because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is that going too far'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because like it's not same as you mentioned the like earlier that it's not the same in europe and the USA college degree like it's definitely not the same in europe either you study'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a university and a good university or you just go and work like you if you don't study but i don't know the logic of the college'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well you that that's not that that's another big difference in europe there isn't just either you go to work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or you go to college'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can also get vocational training in a job make a layer in germany for three or four years to become an expert in your field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it is that counted as a college degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pardon me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is that kind of like the vocation training does it count as a college degree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah that that's that's that's a great question because because the because the the the topic of discussion is framed quite loosely i guess'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no and no it absolutely does not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right perhaps two too loosely i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm we we've had groups that just went on and and brought'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a pros and cons right away but but but i i like that you're a very specific and that you're more detail oriented so so why don't we just say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for the sake of this debate that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that pretty much any'",
        "'speaker_3': 'education'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or or let's say more like theoretical education that doesn't involve on the job experience per se is counted into college degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohk OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that that that that is that is still some somewhat complicated because for example if i wanna become a painter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is it is but but but i think i think the main point is it's about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of learning through a theory versus learning through experience i think that's what it's about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but see that that that that's exactly where the german model deviates from the US model in in the US if i wanna become a painter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh i just start painting and eventually i can get myself a license as a painting contractor and then open up a company or whatever if i wanna open up a company as a painter in germany i have to go and number one make a layer for three years i'm gonna be mostly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pushing the broom for the first year or so and while i'm doing that and learning how to paint i will also be going to school for one or two days a week in order to learn the theory behind that then after i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'finish that qualification i have to work as a gazella for three years and continue to go to school if i wanna be able to become a minister or a master and then be able to open my own company and paint houses for the public'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a six year education but it's really mostly vocational and mostly on the job i mean we're talking eighty percent plus training on the job and to equate that where the college degree number one doesn't really work and number two is in germany seen as something entirely different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK alright then let's let's one moment please let's just make it really simple then let's just say we're just let's say we're talking about jobs only that require a college degree and then we're differentiating between whether the college degree is more important or the experience they get on the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i think that yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a good way to look at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that's why i asked it at the big that let's if you quit defend an idea let's defend it to the end like let's not divide it like ohh yeah at some point it's right at some point it's not like if we defend let's defend it or not like it's better i see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm yeah let let's simplify it because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah great point great point yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what but i i and and i still say that it really depends for example in a field that isn't really a science like economics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there if i'm the employer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but my but but mike you know sometimes it depends on what we want to get out of this debate because if we have to write the pro and cons then we cannot say it depends we cannot be in the middle let's just take the the the side to make it easier for the moderator to write the pros and cons i don't know if they want controversial like the controversial topic something in the middle that is for moderator'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's you know you know like the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i i i see your point margaret i would refer to josh on that and tell him what he needs in the end'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well well i i'm i'm i'm actually a verified with how this is going because because in in the end it's it's about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm the the communication and the interactions that that that occur during this debate i mean so it's fine if we take a bit longer to clarify all that we need'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but so near'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why i am against it depends because you know the the the problem with it depends that we can for every field for every topic for every conversation for everything we can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh say it depends but actually for for almost everything in the world we can say it depends'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's very true yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they send'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not for everything for most things but not for every'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'almost everything yeah yeah so so but but but but but to make it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but but but but but let let let let me give you a hypothetical i started a company twenty years ago it's going quite well i'm getting older i wanna retire and now i need a guy who knows about business so am i gonna hire somebody that is just out of a business school with an MBA or am i gonna hire somebody that also has some education but has experience in running a company'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so the thing is that the the the answer is that the answer is very subjective you can say that from i will hire someone from the with the education and i can say that i will hire someone with the job experience the problem with it depends that it's very subjective so and we are the subject so we have to choose our side and the defend it like i would say it when when we say it depends it's not going anywhere like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what do you do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the second yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well well two two two two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i tried to to that i can say that i have lived in the US for thirty years and i have found a lot of truth in the following statement those who can do and those who can't teach'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the problem with the statement is that it's right this statement is right in every field like who is better messi or ronaldo it depends like who is the better barcelona real madrid it depends it's always right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'independent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'everything depends yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's the it's the problem of it depends because it's never wrong that's why we and it's never clear like it always requires a lot of explanation a lot of discussion hours of discussion and explanation and at the end of hours you still say that ohh yeah no we conclude that it depends'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly how'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it depends'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that that's why i prefer talking about specific cases particular jobs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that makes a lot more sense than to talk about it in general'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK let me then let me in general i can also defend the idea both ideas but let's see my side if my side is a college degree i i can still i will i will try my best to defend that idea but the thing is that yeah the job experience is very important like it's incredibly important i had some internships during my master study in germany and i can see that it's incredibly important but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even when i worked there i had some things that a personally i experienced them i had some things that i saw that i could learn or i should have been learned them in university so there are many things that it doesn't matter what at some point it doesn't matter what because i worked on production as well as a production helper and i also worked in the office as well like six months six months each like i worked'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'never field and i could see that even in the production even with the machines and in office as well still you need a good education it doesn't matter in which field you work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah i yeah i agree with you good education is is is is required is it's not required it is important it will give you an edge'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it it it you need it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you still need the years of experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it doesn't give you an edge actually it gives you a lot'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well actually and another thing to look at is if you look at the different management styles in the US versus in europe in europe it is not uncommon at all for someone to work his way up the ranks and become the leader of a company without having a college degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah that's right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the guy knows every aspect of the company has worked in every different kind of position knows how to relate the different people and knows how the different departments interact with each other and what is required to make the company successful on the other hand you got the US they put somebody in there who doesn't have that fucking clue about anything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that is a good example because see how many how many big CEO we have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and how many like if you count like big quick like CEO 's who don't have a college degree how many do we have like around the world the better popular ones'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well actually the richest people in the world happened to be people without actual degrees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the very simply it's happened even even the in the really it's like google it happens like meta google in really big companies it it really happens like people without education but they are really experienced in their food they can get those things but still i still i believe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they just had experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah they they go to experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they're not necessarily experience what they experienced in is being ruthless and screwing over other people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you might say you might say that but still you see they are running the world and and so it's it's it's really depends on and on i don't want to see you use the when it depends'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's why we are up the creek without a paddle'",
