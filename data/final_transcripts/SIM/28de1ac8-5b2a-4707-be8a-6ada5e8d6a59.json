        "'speaker_4': 'social media because i think that's a private aspect of an employees life and mixing the private aspect and you know the business aspect of unemployed life can somehow feel that they're being you know a checked too much or that they're being interrogated top point that's not satisfactory for them so i feel like it can feel very invasive to appoint so it might not be you know a good idea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i respect that opinion as well because she's also right i was thinking more from the employer 's point of view just in case if a few years down the line if i'm if i start a business and if i want to hire someone i would like to know everything about them so i was thinking from that point of view'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but at the same time i feel like someone 's social media does not define who exactly they are because someone could just be sharing you know maybe they're private aspects of their life about their family maybe photos or family trips and all that that doesn't really you know state what kind of person they are or you know like exactly who they are so it i don't think it would be a very viable measure of you know kind of getting to know the kind of person that you are employing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'prod right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think the big point is the the point of you if you are the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm applier or if you are the company i believe it's a good idea for companies to look at social media sites a reason for looking at one employees social media site is to prevent bad situations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah companies are placed in unwanted situations if a current employee posts bad information about about them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm their reputation could be negatively affected and by a common comment or comment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'made by an employee'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah many employees admit to posting unethical things on social media media so i think you yeah you you have a better idea idea if if the applier fits to the company yeah but the big the big thing is the point of view if you if if i am would be a company'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and searching for for candidates then i would look into the social media sites yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah well since i've run the on the cons side here as well i say like'",

        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a reflective of that person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think it's a review'",

        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would like to add a few pointers here let's uh yeah let's say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and yeah sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everyone in this group is about to start a youtube channel or a facebook page or they're on their own website now now they they're going to do that on a big scale and for that they go to fiver or any other freelance website and they are about to outsource their work to someone so there's competition so before you decide whom you should hire you would definitely try to find more find more information about that person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'through social media that is point number one point number two is whenever a person is gets a job in a in a big company then they would like to inform their close friends and relatives on social media to get some praise and appreciation that i'm working for say reliance group or adani group or maybe microsoft or facebook so they would like to announce everything on social media'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh a company who's about to hire this person would if that person is written in the resume that i have worked for so and so company if a company has access to their social media profiles they would be able to dig inside and find out whether it is true or false so that is one thing point number two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh now i think i should stop and others must give their point of view'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know the truthfulness of the amount of information you're collecting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sir sir are you are you more concerned'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about the let's say ethical side or of the possibility of low reliance meaning false judgment based on that social media'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes exactly the the low relevance of you know the false information that is posted so you know sometimes a lot of people know that going into job seeking or just employment means that someone is bound to you know get a look into your private life or just do a background check on you so in that case you might have people just being not very honest with a lot of the things that they post or just being very limited as to what they post so an employer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doing a background check might not be enough to kind of get a you know view of the kind of person that they're about to employ so a social media background check specifically is very can cover very little information about the person that you are about employee'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you think that those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the applicants could could have a an unfair disadvantage if they happen to have a better social media'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes exactly for example if uh someone is very active on social media has tons of followers has you know just is very social and posting about their life maybe they're travels and everything i think to some extent it can be a fair judgment especially if an employer assumes that just because of a big following that someone is more prone to posting information that is not supposed to be out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think it it can you know affect an employee negatively in the sense that an employer might assume that you know you have this kind of following so you're more and in touch with you know random people so you might you know lick some information or whatnot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm OK the the torsion do you have anything is there after that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no not to add the this this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm team and i've i've'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but another another point yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think as i said if if i would be company i would i do all to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm umm get a better picture of the person how they acting in in in life and in the free time if they if i look at the social media sites and see them only partying have having party and you're only'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah spend time in a bar or in a club or something like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i don't think they do a good job in my in the company or or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm the the right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm applier you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i feel like that's what i'm saying is that that is an unfair judgment of the the person that you're going to employ because you don't really know like this person is you know applying for the job so you don't really know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i see your point but UM the the the person who share'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohm these these'",
        "'speaker_3': 'pictures or or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and yeah when when you when you are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'clubbing or partying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'he must realize that the company can see these things and judge them you know what i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'U M'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so since you're still on the pro side so would you still advocate for companies to not be allowed to look into that because that kind of natural judgment could occur if they looked into their applicants'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the uh social media'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you mean if i would apply these company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no uh is it since you're uh since you're here uh on the pro side in this debate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh so so saying that companies shouldn't be allowed so so would you say that companies shouldn't be allowed because they would naturally judge an applicant by what they post on social media'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i am'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like for example uh something that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but might possibly be understood as something negative if they just went clubbing and partying all the time'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how to say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i believe that the employees are either present or future ones should be incentivized for sharing their social media data with the companies those who share will get a little extra money then they will happily share'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i'd just like to say that based on the point of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know making the natural judgment it's sort of unfair because it kind of puts people into this box that says you know you can't share your personal life and maybe you know it's just you and your your you know your friends that follow you and your family so what kind of limits are you putting on you know your soon to be employees that you're saying you know there's no free you know speech or free you cannot post what you want because you work for this setting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's it's very interesting here because uh abjad is even'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh so applicating here that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there should be a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so employees should be incentivized to share and and and allison you're a completely against that so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we could could you explain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'U M'",
        "'speaker_1': 'where those standpoints uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'come from or or or like or give an example of where if that were applied that that it would show a positively or negatively like for instance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i was not advocating for incentivizing employees to share what if it could that bring in your opinion'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is that question to me or allison'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes yes please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to me OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes to you yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah OK see had i been an employer i would i would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the uh put it across to my future employees that i will incentivize you to share your your social media data with me and they are they are not children they know what they're posting so they would naturally post cautiously but because i'm incentivizing it's a win win situation i'm paying for that data and on the other hand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i will use that data to to you know to give it to my back end team and then they will do some analysis and make a persona or something like that like these are the parameters based on which future employees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'could be hired so say for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh parting uh partying every weekend or spending time with family that is point number two or spending time on entertainment so if i know that out of hundred employees if fifty percent or maybe ninety percent of them are pro family they want to spend time with their family then i would make policies in my organization which would allow them to spend time with their family so they are happy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the productivity goes up at work if my policies goes against that then they will find a ways to switch to other companies so it can be used positively it can be used negatively as allison said it's private life so i definitely respect that it and it is true it is private life but then when we are incentivizing when we are paying for it and the person is voluntarily sharing the data then it's a win win situation for both'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah i i i agree with that you can do it like a tinder match you know and so if you are as aviat said if you are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'light parties and you you you can find an and company which doing events party events you know so you have a match so i think you can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm umm use this information positively'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and we can blend it with work so that they also happy companies also happy those who are pro family can have their own time with the family those who are entertainment movie buffs they can go for movies everything is possible'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but just to touch on a point that you made up that you said at the beginning you said that you give the companies the your social media information willingly or sometimes companies don't ask for that information they find it out for themselves so in this perspective of a company doing a background check on you that you are unaware of what you know what extent of the information that is provided on your social media are they you know attaining and how truthful is that information'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because you know for an example if someone does not use the real names on their social media profiles how are you supposed to know who you're you're doing a background check on and just to you know illustrate the scope of that problem is if if they say that they use their actual names but if you know people have shared names so who exactly are you doing this background check on what information exactly are you attaining and to what extent is that information truthful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i could have an account with my real names posted and i could be posting things about my family and you know just traveling and i could have a second account that does not use my real names and i'll post you know the partying and the clubbing and everything that maybe say that the company does not advocate for so to what extent of information are you gathering and to what extent is that information true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'may i say something like for example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i don't think anybody would be sharing phone numbers on social media at the most they will share pictures or the experiences or experiences include good and bad both or they may be sharing photos videos and but personal things like phone number of my wife or children or you know bank account details or passwords these things will not be shared on social media by anybody'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those things which are already public'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they already know google facebook know everything so rather than you know going against it i would go with the flow let them take the information i'm mature enough to share what i want to share so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no but my my point was that the a person could limit the the amount of information that they give you for example if i have two separate accounts two separate you know profiles like on facebook if i have one facebook that uses my real names'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is my take yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you you're real person and your fake account you know right yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but i have an account that only for my family and friends follow but does not use my real names and i have one that uses my real names to what extent of information can they collect and how true will the information that they're collecting be if they cannot access an account that i post personal things like my clubbing and all the rest but they can only access an account that i post you know family and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'three point two point but i i work in the aerospace industry and there you have to do a background check if you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'begin to work there so it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it is possible to to get the information i don't know how but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it's it seems to be possible to get the the real background information i name it real background so not a fake information you share'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it seems to be possible umm i don't know how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see faking is like something uh i don't think is possible because if if i have two accounts one is public and one is private but i use it i'm using the same computer my IP address is the same my internet service provider is the same and my geographical location is the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then it is not very difficult to identify whether these two people are different or the same'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the the point is not to fake the information the point is to limit the private and public information that you put out so when a company does a background check why should they be able to access information that i put out privately for us a certain you know target audience it's not that i'm sharing it on account that has you know ten thousand followers i'm sharing it on an account that is only followed by my family and friends so such information does not have an impact on the kind of person i am because these are people that know me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if you're doing a background check on an account that has you know ten thousand followers it's a public account it can be accessed publicly by anyone but why should a company be be able to access private information that you only put out to a specified target audience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i believe they are doing it anyways whatever goes on line whatever goes online is public understand that if you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but the the point is why should they be able to it invades privacy to it's very invasive so my point is why should they be able to you know access people social media why can't they just leave some aspects of people 's private lives out of work and you know you know work and play don't make'",
        "'speaker_2': 'say uh say for example say for example when we open an account a facebook page personal or private or a google account or a youtube account'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they are paying for hosting our information so look at from that point of view we we upload a photo or a video'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on any platform somebody is paying for it somebody in the sense that company that corporate is paying for it they are they are hosted and they are saving your data and information it is it is a cost for them now they need to recover this cost by through advertisement and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'definitely i'm not saying that they do things which they are not supposed to do but from a commercial point of view if i'm paying to host someone 's video and photo i need to recover that cost'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i think from that that point of view'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so you you you think they sell the information to the to the companies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i cannot say that but one thing is for sure that without'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'without recovering the cost the company cannot survive and things will not be free anymore then it will be paid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that i think that's that's things we we don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but there are there are people do advertise on social media so definitely there is data which is being collected and stored somewhere and used'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so so abhijit you were talking about that the fact that if companies more into their employees social media accounts that they could'",
