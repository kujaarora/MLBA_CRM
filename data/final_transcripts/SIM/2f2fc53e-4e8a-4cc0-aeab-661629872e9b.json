    "Should the minimum wage be increased? Does minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of their employees?": [
        "'speaker_1': 'one is here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so hello my name is nikita i will be your moderator today before we're gonna start this conversation i'd like to test everyone's audio please say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'great'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great thank you so and the topic for discussion today is should the minimum wage be increased and does minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of their employees do any of you have really strong opinion on this subject'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i would say from experience that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't think minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'should be increased'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nor do i think by default that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it allows us employ i mean surely any employer could take advantage of their employee but i don't think by default it just simply will allow that anymore than what may already be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think my opinion on the matter is so i guess the question is should minimum wage be increased is this specific to any certain country or state or is this globally'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i it could be anywhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like is it you if you would like to talk you can speak about the situation in your in your area or we can speak in general'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no that that that that's fine i think the minimum wage in itself should reflect the national or regional cost of living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know that this is something that should be providing people with the necessities and life there should be able to pay their rent or their mortgage pay their bills without any issues and i mean assuming that they are on the minimum wage and they're working full time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh at the same time give them a bit of balance and allow them to have the necessities in life as well as umm you know a little bit of frugal fun and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i think with regards to increasing the minimum wage i think it should be in line with the rates of inflation and i think if that's not the case then perhaps companies can be taking advantages of these laws to underpay people for the roles that they for the jobs and services that they provide to the organization'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK what about you jordan'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think there's two sides really to this that it affects you you've got the big companies and then you've got the small businesses big companies might be able to take a hit but if you think about the small businesses the family owned businesses especially in these harsh economic times these small businesses by increasing minimum wage you're gonna push them out and you're gonna basically all the business is going to go to the larger companies you've got to think of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it like that as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's a very good point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it's a good point but i think with that it's i i guess taking my consideration with regards to inflation is the the product or service has been sold by these organizations whether there are local business or a massive or a larger corporation everyone's gonna be pushing their price up to reflect the cost of resources to do business and that would be inclusive of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'staff wages right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so just have a question about like as far as local'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i hope so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'employers and versus big companies so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you said that it was it should be increased to reflect the cost of living right so should'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i guess it should it should match the living cost'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so should'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so how would you go about doing that with small businesses versus a bigger mainstream company sort of a big corporation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but what what do you think is the difference between the small business and logical operation in this way in the in the way of the wages'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so and the and in the context of of of finances'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well a larger corporation not only would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have more money but the smaller business may not have either the income to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fund whatever employees they have more to reflect the cost of living which means some companies may not want to or say if there's a smaller local company that needs to hire on people rather than increase the wage of the employees that they already have i would think that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if the if there was a law forcing them to have to pay more well they may not as well just hire this person to begin with and maybe they'll just look for somebody else who has more experience so there's a lot of other factors that we have to take into account whereas a larger corporation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'could definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just increase the minimum wage and as it was said take a hit however you also have to think about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people say former employees or employees that were already hired on and say before the minimum wage hit they started off say at ten dollars an hour'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'let's say the minimum and say they were there for a year after year they worked the way up to twelve or fourteen an hour and then let's say the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they raise it and then they start hiring on new people to start at fourteen an hour'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most if not some companies don't take that into account'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as far as the employees they already have and they don't really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but it usually means that they will everybody will be paid more that's kind of the idea if we're increasing the minimum wage where increasing everyone's salary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right that that that's what we would like to think but i have first hand experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'eventually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i i once worked at at DHL the shipping company and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was using my experience as an example so they did that and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'years ago they i think this was around twenty nineteen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and when they did that they didn't take into account as they should have for the employees they already had hired on and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rather than'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reflecting their minimum wage increase say two dollars so say i started off at twelve and i after a year worked my way up to fourteen and yet after that year they hire on people for fourteen an hour they will tell the employees they already have OK we're gonna go ahead and raise your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'minimum wage but it may be for only about fifty cents or a dollar'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that wouldn't be fair because to begin with they raised the minimum wage two dollars so if anything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the employees that were already on and had to work hard to get to the fourteen an hour should get sixteen but unfortunately that isn't the case which would be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sort of contradictory to what the statement is is the question of do you think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'minimum wage would allow employers to take advantage of their employees on the contrary it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'could they corporations could raise their minimum wage and yet still take advantage of their employees that they already have on because they're hiring on new people to get paid what they had to work a year to get'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's a that's a very good point that you're making'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the the answer for that will be that they're gonna do it anyway'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like if they can cut your salary they will cut that it's the thing about the bigger operation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i i guess the idea that the minimum wage is booted on there any businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from the outside it's a government thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think we with that it's you know they're going to be raising i mean they can be hiring at the minimum rate and if they can keep people at the minimum rate they'll do so because that's a cost cutting exercise which is ultimately how large corporations can effectively run right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that that is true isn't it businesses that the biggest cost factor for any business is employees they are the biggest cost for any business'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and also one thing i i'd like people to think about think about is if you raise the minimum wage for everyone so everyone's got more spending power you've gotta think that's a that's potentially quite a large increase for the company i mean they're having to pay every single employee more money they're probably gonna pass that on in terms of prices on to the consumer so then they employees so everyone everyone's got more money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'culture'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and but then prices go up as well so in terms you kind of gotta see they've got more money but everything 's more expensive at the same time people have got more money to buy things people need to produce more things so then cost come up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and as a as a result you know like to inflation yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so that's another thing to take into account of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah cost costs irrespective of wage increases and if there are other factors that are driving prices aren't this gonna happen anyway so i guess as an example of something goes up to from twenty pounds for a product to twenty pounds twenty five pounds product and you know it it could be a case of the resources required to produce that has only gone up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two pounds but organizations it's you know it's just the way business they gonna be bumping their prices up and yeah it it gets more expensive for the consumer but it's gonna get more expensive for the consumer regardless of whether employee wages are going to be increased or not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so your argument would be if it's gonna go up anyway let's go ahead and raise people 's minimum wage so that they can afford this new higher cost of living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'upset'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah to to spend this money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so wouldn't that also cause more inflation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it you know united states is a kind of is a good example for that that you know last time we had the national minimum wage increase was in two thousand nine and well and inflation has increased a lot since then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some would argue that we are in a recession in the united states'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's kind of like the the they probably not directly related'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so what what which which country is this in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry this is two thousand and nine in the united states'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so there are a lot of examples we can use so california raised their minimum wage to fifteen an hour but their cost of living skyrockets and texas you only pay and here's just one example gas good example right i won't talk about that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is a local minimum wages uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's started parts of texas there may be up to say three fifty and maybe even three ninety nine in the lower parts in in in sort of the cheaper parts of lemon tech is it could be as low as two twenty five to fifty and that's right now but if you go to california they raised everything up the minimum wage to fifteen an hour that is the state law but what that did was increase of course the cost of living so you don't really find that you have more money to pay for stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's just sort of a never ending cycle where now gas is six dollars a gallon which is insane'",
        "'speaker_2': 'price of groceries went up i would say two times so in california they have the price per gallon is more than two times the amount you could say in some areas then it would be in say texas'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which reflects the cost of living'",
        "'speaker_2': 'raising it to fifteen dollars an hour but nothing changes you don't have more money the value that you have now has decreased'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ten fold in some cases'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'll give you a count example like i live in tennessee and we we don't have state minimum wage we use the federal one so our minimum wage has not increased increased in last in a you know since two thousand nine price is low have increased a lot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'without you know any'",
        "'speaker_1': 'while everybody else pretty much getting paid about the same amount as they will getting paid in two thousand nine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so like i'm not sure if it's that direct layer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so let me ask you though how why do you think that the prices increased in tennessee and general'",
        "'speaker_1': 'influencing that uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the the the there is there is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a bit because in general inflation is not that related to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wages'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it it it it it does it does it does play a part so it so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what were you saying that the prices did increase right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they did increase yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i'm just asking where do you think it came from why do you think the price is increased'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i think part of it is you know that the corporations are just trying to squeeze as much more profits as they can so that's why we have groceries and get an increased'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's everywhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if america is importing from elsewhere and everyone else is driving their prices are up that ultimately will end up being paid by the consumer you know if you're importing apples from argentina or somewhere in or if you're importing tomatoes from europe and the costs of fuel have gone up then the cost of transporting from there to the united states would increase and that will ultimately need to be reflected in the final product'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's actually a really good point it's a very good point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well you know get guess and then in general because you know it's very volatile in a way so it changes a lot pretty much every year how much we pay for the oil or for the gas'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so kind of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no no but i'm i'm not specifically saying it's just that i mean i was just using an example'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah you eat he's saying the consumer goods in general sort of overall right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm it too'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so so what whether the cost of manufacturing the cost of growing the cost of transport if they're all gonna go up and they're going to be passed on to the consumer anyway and if they if if the consumers are not or if employees are not getting a pay rise then how are they gonna continue to afford that it's the the way to get by is you're going to have to consume less and less'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that's a really good point earlier you made about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'other countries and things that we import they may raise their prices so a good let's see'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a good example of that earlier'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think i i'm sorry what was your name the moderator'",
        "'speaker_1': 'nikita'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the kid OK so earlier you said how the basically the private companies the private organizations these big corporations are the the reason for inflation you're saying they're the ones that are raising the prices on everything whereas'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well at least in last two three years yes during the covet they that like huge profit margins and last year too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that's a good point and they are but to go a little bit further and a little bit deeper as to the reason why they are so i would say the beginning'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and to get straight to it to be blunt the government would be the reason why so the reason why this reason all these prices is to account for a lot of these a lot of more printed money that the government is doing so how this affects his companies is because say it's twenty twenty everyone was gaining similis checks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you see two years later people are still getting stimulus checks people are still'",
        "'speaker_2': 'getting free money so there's a lot of different ways that this can affect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how companies raise their prices so for an example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so you you're putting a you're ultimately putting it down to a matter of supply and demand is because people have more money than they they have more to spend therefore it's a case of increasing prices just because people can afford that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going using'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not necessarily supply and demand it's more like the money that they are giving is being printed which is decreasing the value of the money itself because of the printing itself and so to use your example that other countries are increasing their prices so that we have to pay more here's a great example whenever joe biden became president of the united states'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'he didn't allow us to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'drill for our own oil anymore in america what this did was what this did was have to have us rely on oil from other countries now in doing so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we had to pay sad prices since they charge more to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'import those that that oil and so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who is going to pay for that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'american civilians to the people the working class'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and so how we go about doing that is increasing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'taxes increasing cost of goods cost of living so to go back to my point just before this if that were to happen which did already and now it's just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's gotten a little better but so when that did happen companies for example truckers who have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'transport to goods'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to where they need to go require more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so they need to get more gas but because of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'government not allowing us to do our own oil to get our own gas so that could be cheaper we have to rely on gas from other countries now what that data is increased the price of gas so now the truckers have to pay more gas money for the gas to deliver any consumer goods at all now what that also does is raise the price from the companies they have to raise the price to pay for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well that's it said that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let let let me ask you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'did did did the prices for the gasoline decreased in last i don't know several months because i remember summer was really expensive it was like four or five here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm so yeah it it it has over in the UK i think it went down from an average of about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and i i need to tell like it like the decrease of the you know cost of gas have not decreased the cost of the groceries for example there are still it's expensive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it has it has here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i'm i'm yet to i'm yet to see grocery prices to decrease'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no you're right and the reason why is because so this this is basically further proves my point the the reason why is because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the value of our dollar isn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'increasing it's it's it's steadily staying the same because there's still being money printed they're still giving out for example stimulus checks so it's not so much as a supply and demand it's more so the value of the money itself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'my my may i may ask you do do you still get the stimulus check because i stopped getting them in twenty twenty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well if you don't need one you don't but you can definitely still get one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some people are still getting up to to and this is not the only means of inflation but the effects of the inflation that has gradually occurred over time even though stimulus is have decreased sure the people that do still get them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'call'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well of course not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'let's say unemployment certain certain states not texas not a lot of the other seven states florida certain other states'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'still still get a decent amount of stimulus and there was also talks of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'allowing certain uh income'",
        "'speaker_2': 'based families to receive i think it was upward of and and this doesn't sound realistic but you can sort research this if you'd like i think it's around where to a hundred K of salary a year'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and this is only in select a location but that is not the only reason but that would be another factor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but please tell me about this location because i'm moving there like immediately'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well if you did uh that's that'd be that'd be a good point to actually to make a lot of people are gonna do that so that they wouldn't have to work so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if people don't want to work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're going to keep getting the money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how are you going to compete and if you if you were a company and you raise your prices so that everyone everyone could get paid a bit more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's in in every unit circle of having to reflect the cost of living but that cost of living will go up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because of all the other factors that we've all mentioned consumer goods gas'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so i guess the idea is that it should be up to the free market'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK that's OK i i i just want to hear from other people please join us guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm well i think our arguments on the other side because we're european and we're not american so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we we don't feel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it's good to see how the points yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah no no and i think this this was the point that i was making it's like it's just shouldn't i think whatever in the UK we have the office of the office of national statistics that does like cost of living benchmarks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'month on month year on year and i guess the bank of england get involved and you know they are just the interest rates to to be to kind of combat the inflation so there's like a healthy battle between the two and i think you know using those sort of benchmarks is if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and a lot of organizations within the UK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i guess in the rest of europe as well at least historically have well not necessarily minimum wage i'm not too sure about what the mechanics are behind that but let's say for a salary job they they do typically increase their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that salaries in line with inflation but over the last few years they have not been able to do that because of how high inflation has been however i think the the the argument for that is if someone is on a decently salaried living wage then you know maybe there's no there's not on a median there's not an immediate requirement to do so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'however those who are on the minimum wage they are going to be the ones that are going to be for that are gonna be falling behind on their bills so they're the people that definitely need it so i think yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if we were to benchmark uh inflation rates and wage growth in a similar line then i think that's for the people that need it and it will happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or it should happen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'jordan please join us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'was was a good was a good point in the question and i think that's in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'something to consider is that companies essentially have most of the power'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK i'm sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know at the moment in the UK we we're having a lot of strike action there's a lot of people striking and at the moment with our current government they're they're more likely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's really good i like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but that but that's but that's but those are public sector workers they're not private organizations so i guess the argument there is it's not just private companies that could take advantage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who is in the strike actually now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well you could argue that the government is technically a you know is an employer it's it's kind of akin to being a company in a way it instead of saying companies i should say employ employers you know can take advantage because essentially they have options which work as you can say workers have options in that they could look for another job for example but again that's then putting yourself under the power of another employer but employers have the power in the sense that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i guess so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they say you raise minimum wage and they're going ohh well we don't really want to have to afford that extra cost you know they've got options they can pass it on to consumers they can think umm maybe we could get by with less workers you know let them go makes the remaining ones work more time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know they've they've got different options'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and say you're the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or you can use the eye or you can move some of your production out outside of the country'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah you could you could technically move your yeah you could move your labour below abroad and you could charge less money that way yeah there's there's different options that they can take and you could argue employees do have some options you know and they you could have skills especially where skills are involved say you know you need some highly skilled it engineers they could argue well there's not many of us so you need to pay us more if we're going to take up any of your jobs you know there's and then the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the companies compete with each other for those employees that's an example of the of the workers having power'",
        "'speaker_2': 'send me an example of the free market going to work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think in recent times we've seen that free market ideology not working as well as it should i would argue'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and like what what example'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and well you see at the moment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi you know with the current climate you've got supply issues you know raising inflation as well but we've had in the UK for the past you know over over a decade we've had austerity measures from the government'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so we haven't i think some someone mentioned we haven't had a a minimum wage increase since two thousand nine for example and public sector hasn't had any wage increases well or or if they have it's been you know it's been below inflation far below inflation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm and i think we've seen i would argue i think we've seen companies reluctant to invest in in the companies or their employees'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i definitely think in the UK we've got a lack of productivity and that is due to companies not investing in their people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're looking to find someone they can pay the least amount of money without having to train anyone and usually that means that can mean recruiting skilled labor from abroad so you see that's another option of companies they're always looking for a way to maximize their returns and that isn't usually in the best interests of the of the employees and i think because they have that power it's very difficult to get around that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'look'",
        "'speaker_2': 'say they do you know hire someone else and they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they want to hire said person for lower than they'd like so that they can take on more work and would you say though that itself is sort of exploitative'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i think it could be say there's quite a few examples if you've ever looked at jobs online you see the examples where they don't they withhold the salary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i think that's purposeful because they don't want you to know how much they're currently paying their employees so they could potentially play pay you lower'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then you get wage discrepancies so you could be working with someone who does exact same job as you but they're earning you know they're earning like ten ten or twenty percent more is that fair is that in the employees employees best interest probably not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i guess there is a problem here that if one company does it then you know it's good for this company ohh at least you know for the management of this company or for owners of this company but if absolutely everyone is doing that then it means that everybody is getting paid less and for that reason they can buy less and for that reason they you know it's harder to sell people things because they just have less money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so as to say that if that does happen one company may say hey come over here because they're not treating you well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the end we sort of take away a bit of the power from the employee itself and this discussion because there is a voluntary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's sort of a voluntary transaction happening between both employer and employee right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the the idea that you you mean that the you should unite yeah that they should unite for example and demand their own things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so let's say there is right so let's say there is an exploitation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the idea that the government should be the one to impose law would probably not be the best way to do it maybe private i'm sorry unionization you say privatization would probably be a better way so it's not so much as these things aren't happening it's more of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that probably isn't the best way to deal with it another law forcing these companies to have to pay a bit more so we can also use local smaller company as an example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but you can say that for example government also regulates the law on unionization and i is example of tennessee for example pretty much forbidden'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that's why i say private you what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right that's why i say private unionization that might be a little bit better i mean a lot of times most times if not yeah it doesn't really it's not really the case and that's sort of the whole point of it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you can actually everyone get together and say hey we're gonna work for you we're gonna work with this company i think that you should pay us all more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you'll definitely make some some changes that way and so for someone who wants to get a job and they withhold the salary amount and eventually do tell them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'before they sign and you know say if your if you have a good head on your shoulders you should know to be able to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'talk about what you would like to get paid and so in the end there's also a bit of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sort of a voluntary decision on the employees part to make their case and so yeah these big corporations are big big guys mean guys but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in that same regard the employees going about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ways that don't don't involve creating laws from the federal government would probably be a better way to deal with this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see i i agree with you that unionization is is very good way for the employees to you know to have some control over you know what what they receive from the employer however i would argue that the government often has shown at least in the UK i think in the US as well has shown that they are willing to work against that in fact i'd say they they usually working in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they would usually say in the public 's best interest but also companies as well and that they don't like unions being able to have that power to you know to stop a service working and you know affecting the economy so as we we've seen recently with our prime minister rishi sunak i think he said he was gonna next week push through legislation to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'essential services have to meet'",
        "'speaker_4': 'certain standards'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if they're going to strike basically they have to meet certain i think they have to have a certain number of employees you know in place their services have to be running at a certain rate if they're gonna strike so basically kind of say you can't strike'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you can strike OK uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i mean that's just a draconian measure to say if it's not like this and you can't strike it will yeah yeah it's basically that it's an anti strike law isn't it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i i guess'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it makes it difficult though isn't it for the the working people where'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know ultimately the government is your employer but at the same time they're telling you that you can't you know go ahead with your union and strike so what what what can you really do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well theoretically you know if government is even player you also vote for you know for the politicians and you the idea is that you gonna vote out everyone who you know makes these draconian measurements and they would lose you know their power'",
        "'speaker_2': 'excellent point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'somehow it doesn't work at least in the united states'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a great point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i mean that that's what it's looking that's what it's looking like in that's what it's looking like in the UK if you've been following well i guess you probably not that interested in UK politics but yeah the conservative ratings have absolutely plummeted over the last couple of years'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but why do you think this is still you know using this draconian measurements even that they know they're gonna lose you know the validity of world'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh but yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know we might we might be going off topic if we start discussing that i think we're heavily going to go off topic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a good it's a good question though'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think we i think we will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i can talk all day if you i can talk talk all day about that if you want but it's not necessarily gonna be relevant to the conversation at hand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah the wages'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well OK but then the truth is that yes the free market will be wonderful but we already have government in place and it exists and it's it is it's involved in everything'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know to a certain degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'does it mean that we should just like work on restricting the government or does it mean that we need to kind of use the government as a tool for also for other groups and interests'",
        "'speaker_2': 'would be using the very government'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that causes most of the problems to say hey can you do something about it rather than leaving some in the US a lot of the control with the states so there's also that instead of the federal government so that could that could also be a good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you say that there is a difference between federal and state government for for the for the reason'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well there is so california there it's a state law to have fifteen dollars minimum wage texas because i live in texas so that's why i use texas it's the same as the federal minimum wage so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they did do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rather than even then if it if they left it up to the states'",
        "'speaker_2': 'passing a law probably wouldn't be the the the the best way so you know if you can use california as an example it's like one of the most expensive places to live'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but rather if you can sort of do less'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with the government so if they're if they're if they have their hands in everything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why ask them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to help fix it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they probably be the last'",
        "'speaker_2': 'business if you will to trust rather maybe there are other ways to go about it and so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the idea that you're sort of this third party looking in at this transaction between employer and employee this this this voluntary act and you say oh well you probably could have got paid a little bit more or the employer had a bit more money if you want to follow the more maybe you could have got it or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know i could get it but you didn't or this is that you are now imposing your view'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on uh the actors that are engaging in the voluntary act themselves and that is very odd to do and we don't really do that in any other area in life and it's it just seems so weird to do in the area of economics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so you prefer kind of absolute three months in this way that any type of regulation should be out of the question'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but not local or anything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well suppose that although it can help but it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for example there is safety regulations right should they still be there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like you know osha and these guys'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i guess the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well within the context of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that's actually a really good example that's actually really good people so we need we need those we need those we need those health guidelines right make sure everyone 's safe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well yeah yeah i worked in the places where we kind of like the companies were really trying to cut down on the like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is it safe to you reasons like theoretically you could say like i could i should have waited'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i did at some point but you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like if people would not die on the workplace it would be a great thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i i i have a question so i mean this is more to both of you american speakers here it's do you say the national minimum weight or the federal minimum wage is about two dollars or whatever it is well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no it's it's seven around seven fifty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's seven twenty five to be exact'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so how how how so so how is it that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or something like that yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it would did you say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'seven twenty five per hour'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes per hour'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and let's say your your state in in in your state that is that is also the minimum wage right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so if someone works full time are they able to afford rent are they able to afford their bills are they able to afford their groceries'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well not like the the there is the idea that there are other ways of income'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but the whole idea of having a i guess working isn't you shouldn't you know you're not supposed to be working around the clock just to survive are you if let's say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you know i've i've global working week or especially in europe it's it's typically around thirty five hours a week is what's contracted but but let's let's say we'll go to the upper end and say let's say forty hours a week if someone is working forty hours a week on minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are they able to you know afford a living with without having to with without having to you know have additional sources of income because what what if people don't have those skills in order to have an additional source of income and they don't have any support to learn any new skills to do so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't think so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i i think part of the other other sources of income will be like government subsidies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like either on the rent or maybe you know some you know own food'",
        "'speaker_1': 'when it comes or if maybe like you have you're part of the larger family where everybody is working on the minimum wage but and you live in a very tiny apartment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm it's good and to go back to the point earlier so that that these these supplemental income sources can really help'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but can also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm cause a good bit of death detriment if it happens to be more than need to be so just just an example people on unemployment benefits say and i believe it was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hard washington so washington state the benefits come up to over a hundred thousand i've said this earlier to come up to over a hundred thousand dollars i believe a year and this is if they do have families so if they have a family of four'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you you you really don't need a hundred thousand dollars to do that and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not sure if they would still actually don't know if they still can qualify for other like snap and whatnot but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'may maybe maybe cost of living there is that expensive you know you like i lived in san francisco at some point hundred thousand there would be almost nothing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like probably right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not sure just about the washington state'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right well see that's that's a good point to make so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and trying to solve it to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'raise the the income'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that you know has a indirect effect of raising the cost of living as well because they're that money has to come from somewhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what well guys i i'm sorry to kind of stop that but it was really interesting discussion and i hope we're gonna meet again and discuss more subjects but really kind of you know we are a bit over the time here'",
