    "Is animal testing justified?": [
        "'speaker_1': 'alright so uh my name is brian i'm the moderator today so we wanna have a a good discussion so go back and forth reminder to everyone they want you at least six minutes of audio from each person so make sure you jump in get your opinion out there don't don't worry too much about interrupting doing nicely but they do want those kind of breaks and in the conversation so we are talking about is animal testing justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the topic today before we jump into that so wanna do a quick audio check so if each view can say your name and then say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'll i'll go my name is brooke and it's the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK sounds good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah my name is margaret and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah my name is jason rat and the quick brown fox run over the lazy dogs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright perfect so we are uh good to go so i'll start it off the is anybody have a strong opinion on this whether animal testing is justified one way or the other'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah for me uh i'll say first you know UM we have to look at why why do we use animals for testing and because of that reason we look at the reasons later but because of those reasons i'll say it is just finding some cases but it's not just finding other cases like for example cosmetics like we don't have to use animals for cosmetics but if it's really really important like for example for medical like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'let's let's say we had covid recently'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and if we need to use animals for for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to you know to test the covid Q and and and vaccines probably yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i agree i agree with that i can see both sides but i agree it depends on the circumstances i completely agree with the cosmetic side of it and that i don't feel that that's OK but for medical purposes like she said vaccines it's i think it's really important i think that yes you know humans and animals we we are different but what's the alternative you know what what is the alternative you can't use human testing for everything'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah the the good thing about alternatives yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'chilling i also second that although the matter is highly justified and is also highly debatable debated as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the controversial topic we all know on one hand proponents of animal testing argue that it is necessary in order to advance medical and scientific research'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and to develop treatments as well right and cure for diseases'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah that's some point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so they argue that by testing new drugs and treatments on animals and researchers can identify potential side effects and determine their safety you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's well you're not you know one thing i usually ask myself i'm i'm not into animal research but do we do do the researchers release like information about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'before conducting clinical trials'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm like how successful was the the thing or they were testing for example if someone is developing covid treatment and they have used animals like maybe it's fifty hundred thousand animals and you know most of those animals usually die and but we don't get it we don't get to know if the what what was the end like the cure was secured and the animals maybe were released or they died or what happened at the end you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's something that we don't get no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes this is well in in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a good point and then that's something to to i think to that that's a big discussion about yeah it it could have been a a cure but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh you know was all the testing successful how successful was it and do we have those statistics that that's something that's tracked and something that should be tracked and regulated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i was gonna say is there a way to i'm sure there is i'm sure it's out there but the percentage of animals that actually do survive and are able you know you you're able to see the outcome of whatever'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i you know the experiment was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know i don't believe i don't believe if they do release you know they statistic like how many animals died in this experiment and how many survivor i i don't believe they do i haven't seen but probably something they need to because we have to understand it do we have to judge and see if this year west maybe if you are developing a kind of medicine and we have like ten thousand animals died and the medicine was not successful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then it's so it's very painful for animals you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes kind of underspecified yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's painful for animals as well ultimately the decision of whether animal testing is justified i i for me it often comes from down to weighing the potential benefits of the research against'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm ethical considerations name'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the life of the animal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah some organizations and other governments also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so that could bring up the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'use a test'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that that could bring up the question should it only be used for like breakthrough'",
        "'speaker_1': 'breakthrough medicines or or you know in a case of like covid because i'm sure there are a lot of companies out there a lot of funding that uses animal testing that are gonna be like alternative drugs might just be a competitor in the market and they're using they're using animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah exactly that's the other thing actually brought up you brought up a very good point because like there are different maybe five medical companies and they're all using animals to develop a cure for one thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i think that is also something that can be looked at because we don't have to all use animals to to to compete in our business we can have like this this yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at some point it gets unnecessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'unnecessary yeah because that is overuse of animals for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for our benefit their competitive advantage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and do we know about the regulations that are put in place you know i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are are there regulations i'm sure there are you know like things they for sure can't do to the animal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a regulations yeah there could be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you know that the relationship i haven't read them but i also saw i know i i saw stand for the stanford they have advocated a lot about you know ethical treatment of the animals i'm i'm not sure i i yeah probably they're regulations out there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what i have and i did look up some statistics beforehand for this i mean it says only five percent of animals that are using experiments that actually protected by US law which US the animal welfare act yeah doesn't apply for about ninety five percent so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a lot of those i think like rats and mice and all all the smaller ones i guess nobody's like you know stood up it's i think i think it's mainly like monkeys and bigger ones that they started regulating more but as far as like animals like mice it seems like it's just fair game to do whatever'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's what i was yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i don't care'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and the mice i i feel for for for those because the mice are the like the they are the ones we use a lot more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and so helpless actually yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they are helpless like yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and and everywhere you see even small labs to bigger labs the i mean the two the go to animal should be always the mice and rats and smaller animals like that yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i didn't i didn't know that they are not regulated i thought like all animals are regulated i i didn't know that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that's very sad'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and i'm sure i'm sure there's i mean there's there's plenty of countries out there too there's fewer regulations and obviously like countries like china which if they're if they wanna do something as a government they're just you know they're gonna do it so i'm sure it's there are definitely cases like like that out there but the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i think the scale is even i mean not that much it's in smaller scale they do but not not in a vast majority of the testings like a huge number or something like that it's not like that anymore so they have i i think it it it it has the number has reduced a lot compared to the previous testing results'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah and and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the labs yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you know nowadays there's also i i read about cloning you know like you know you know the sheep called dolly who was a clone yeah a clone of another ship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wasn't wasn't that the first successful cloning of an animal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'clone the cloning per successful cloning'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah OK OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my knowledge is the first one yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so i was also thinking like for example it can be something like that i don't know if a clone of animal will be considered as as animal itself but probably that would be another way of not using the animals themselves'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are not it it might not be justified you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like with the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because it's not necessarily the same you know it's similar but it's genetic makeup'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it still but nowadays they have the thing called in in in future you know you've heard of in in vitro testing where they have these cells in the the the chip like the computer chips'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's yeah it's not just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it might not have all the ingredients'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in instead of using animal now they use the the cells in the chip'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that that's that's a good point with the with technology advancing and you know as as we get further into it it it should be that animal testing is less and less but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm it but on the flip side and this is this is the point that it's probably still cheaper for companies scientists to use animal testing versus maybe some of those more advanced ones or if they're ready for human trials you still have to pay humans usually to do that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of course yeah of course yeah it's a it's another layer of cost but but now that's where the debate is it's it's costly versus the right of the animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thank you for the difference yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because we want to advance technology want to advance your business we want to compete in business but yeah is it just fine to have you know like all of those things for poor animals who cannot advocate for themselves'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i was going to bring up that point i mean i am an animal lover myself i have two dogs and i mean i understand a dog is very different than a mouse and but you know it's still it's just it's i i don't they didn't still feel pain you know so it's just thinking about that part right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they do yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they go swelling pain because they're living living living being so they just can't just just cannot express their feelings because they are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a given an estasia or something that that never that to to i mean to so that they cannot react as much as they would so that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well then that would wouldn't that affect the outcome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they don't have a choice you know like we we humans we have a choice we usually opt out you know when you are in the research like you can opt out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah we have a choice we we can say no because but the yeah the the animals cannot say no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make it yeah they cannot opt out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and there there's a statistic i saw when i throw this out and get you guys opinion on it is actually from this is again this just in the just in the US but the department of agriculture did a study they said just in one year there were three hundred thousand animals that were used in testing that involved pain so just in the US in one year only in testing with pain those three hundred thousand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes can you imagine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we consider yeah other countries'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's that a lot of research exactly as a huge number'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there's still obviously a lot of testing going on that is harming animals because i think this is number is twenty twenty nineteen was that those years from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and you know the the animal show and they express the feelings the pain and the stress but it's only that they cannot talk what you you can see you know stress anymore show'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like they show their stressed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but it's only that they cannot talk'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and for me it kind of contradicts with the idea that in many foreign countries like i come from a south asian country so here a lot of stray dogs you say astray cats you will see a lot of them in the streets and there are no one to take care of them but in other foreign countries who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that does the research'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how come they're so into the animals testing i even i don't get it it it kind of contradicts the i mean there motive actually because they also have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that actually ohh i i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the animals'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and how come they also put so much tests to these animals as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm yes and that that just made me think i used to work at an animal shelter we would save mainly cats and dogs but a couple years ago they decided that they were going to fly to egypt and save i think that it was twenty dogs that were on the verge of being killed or used for experiment you know a scientific experiment and so kind of seeing that first'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's seeing those these precious animals that flew over here from egypt because the shelter i worked for i i'd not sure how they got connected to the specific whatever you wanna call it in egypt where these animals were gonna be used for lord knows what but that just that really pulled at my heart strings and so you know i i i don't know i i'm not exactly sure what they were going to do with these animals but i knew i do know it was going to be a pretty big variety of pretty inhumane things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and it's just saying you know yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and cause i'm sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we all love that happen in the US with you know of course we never leave with dogs and cats but there could be happening other countries and i guess it's just where where people draw the line that there there's enough protesting against it and i think a lot of the protesting was against monkeys the the big one i mean i know there's some people that protest like the lab mice but it seems like the smaller the animal the less of a pet than the less people care and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah very very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the line of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh the monkey'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe that's why i would never you know hasn't the numbers have been going down dramatically'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even mice and rats cannot be if they cannot be tamed as well so that's the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'another reason maybe because no one is concerned'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe we could probably that because they are not owned you know it's like there is no owner yeah they're not owned and so no one can claim and get and say like my my my mouse my rat'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they are not going to contact me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like something captain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and so i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my little rat timmy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah my little ride is going to be useful experiment the so yeah but but i i'm not sure do you know in in US that we don't use uh dogs right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no i don't think this in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we we don't use dogs like the pet for pet folks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in many countries they use for office as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i i according to my knowledge i've gathered yeah they use even frogs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah frogs are definitely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know and and some of them uh i'm not sure what the like some they'll use you know after they've after they've died so that the live testing that sure exactly a full list animals but it's funny you mentioned with the pets i was just thinking like guinea pigs popped in my head because yeah that's kind of like a saying like i'll be you'll be my guinea pig for this test this but i don't hear about guinea pigs being tested on anymore i wonder if it's because people started having them as pets'",
        "'speaker_4': 'fix yeah it's too big'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get a fix over here just i guess that's why'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it it has come to an extinction maybe in apics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think they would do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i've never thought about that yeah someone 's a guinea pig for something huh i've never put that together'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think uh yeah i think people started having this pets and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess like less testing maybe happens on i'm not sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah oh that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah just something like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah go ahead go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes you are saying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no you know you know i was i was saying that you know the the closer the animal is to human the more they get used for experiments you know i mean closer in terms of the like the logical like the biology like the way they are the genes and and also the health problems that they get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'had a really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and this one yeah that's why the mice uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'very what like they used to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot more than others because of that like the the similarities with humans so probably probably the guinea pig is the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because i think it's like my supposedly this year like about ninety eight percent of you know genetics with humans so that so they're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with you in mind'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah that's why the one yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and the monkeys too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah i know the monkeys are really close it's even even more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i guess a lot of it too goes into the trust like you know we we take the word for it again from the scientists that OK this animal testing was the reason we got this done but should there be i guess more questioning could you have gotten this breakthrough another way or with you know less harmful testing on the animal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know the other thing i was thinking is that we use animals for testing that you know medicines and like mostly industrial medicine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but my thinking was if we we we learn more towards traditional like using naturally natural medicine like for example trees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah herb herb herbal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like this you know the the natural things and we can use those to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to create medicines to create cosmetics then we don't have to test because we know if if i'm using'",
        "'speaker_3': 'spinach spinach is not harmful for humans so i can even use human to test my spinach medicine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but everything does not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but maybe from from the herbs you cannot make i'm i mean you cannot cure all the diseases most probably that's why the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i i think i'm haven't explored enough'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i have not they have maybe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like research is not into that direction we know ginger can cure a cough and things from our ancestor back then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but most of the heart'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's because they were trying and testing on themselves that's why we we we go to to use those so probably research was supposed to go toward that direction focus more into natural things that they can even if you tell to be tested with winter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that's that's when the economics come in it's definitely tougher to sell cause like we can go to the grocery store and get ginger for cheap and if if if you find out it's just that's some all natural things you can just go get then they can't sell you fifty dollars a pill'",
        "'speaker_3': 'eggs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes yes this is for business reasons because if you tell me this medicine is made of ginger and spinach'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can i can make my own'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but now thinking about animals probably this is supposed to go that direction'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that way is to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i've i've had the debate before that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the health industry the medical industry is such a money making field that the cure to cancer might be out there but you know how many people would be out of jobs if they cured cancer so you know it's such it's all about the money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's all about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'money has to fail huge part otherwise even solution now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if we saw it during covid it it became it's not like working hard to find a vaccine for kovid it was fighting for who will find it first'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh exactly yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and going to be famous and who is making a lot more money it it it became down like it came down to about money and business'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even just copied itself so even with the animals it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the mices are used as a scapegoat that's what i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well even even you know we're talking about the you know a lot of the the businesses and the the medical companies'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that they are trying their children and they're trying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's also a lot of college research happening that are are grants are users that are using animals so i mean there's still money involved with that and if you have if you have a grant from the government to keep doing this testing then are you going to admit OK this testing is really not that effective we want to do it or you just gonna keep taking the money and getting paid to do your research'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh for sure they're gonna keep taking the money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for sure the the the money of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah because you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'who doesn't want me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and that's where the conflict of interest is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think we're all in agreement that yeah like cosmetics things that aren't i guess medical related or potential like breakthroughs for helping humans that the that those are not and and do those and that's not some i didn't look up did those does that happen much anymore i know it's a big thing obviously the man i don't know much about the makeups and all that so it is that i know there's their branding like animal cruelty free and all that so is that is there still testing on animals for cosmetics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like absolutely necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that i i believe there is a company that released the the abandoned complete they completely abandoned'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm making cosmetics like like testing their cosmetics on animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i believe they they give a statement i i will search and and and send to you in a chat quickly but i remember i saw that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but but you know from from the end you know everyone is finding a niche you know like if they stop doing the animal testing what everyone else is doing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's also it's it's a business uh so it's a business opportunity or it it gives them a name and like it's a brand so so they use they used it more of like a brand not not a commitment because they are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they just use the opportunity because the animal activists they have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on them like why are you using animals just for cosmetics and so they took that opportunity you know to make a brand out of it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then you think oh that's a nice company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah in some of those companies they might test on animals for half of their stuff and not on the other half and they're doing a marketing campaign talking about these products are not animal testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when i was reading'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they have they have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'another test'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but not across the board'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i just found something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i read that then there there were more there were writing more on like we are not doing that we are now going in natural we are going all natural and we are doing things natural now and all animals and we don't need to test anything everything we're using it safe and blah blah so more of a marketing stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i just found something it says'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you're right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'testing this is from green matters dot com says testing on animals is required for all new medications used in the united states and is still required in china for the cosmetic industry so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so it says animals'",
        "'speaker_4': 'testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'used for medicine in the US and then cosmetics and china animals are used'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i wonder i mean it's just a difference of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh too many of you know whether after the test being done are the animals safe or do it it hampers their life lifetime'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i mean that's a very good question i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah you know some of them not only tempering some of them die some of them permanent damage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some of that's right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and and then and those are majorities like dying and and permanent damage is majority very few you know at the end of maybe success'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when they are successful in finding the the medicine probably and that's very rare those final ones will will'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because you need a lot of i mean even if you make basic medicines it might need a lot of animals to test because to be successful you need a lot of trials right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm and the L ones usual die and the middle ones that come on in damage and then the last one probably will survive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so like every other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the the last one the last prototype will be the one that we supply to the market so before that every other animal might get pampered yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'most'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it's not just a minor hamper it might'",
        "'speaker_4': 'although they are animals but it they're losing their life so this is for me it's unjustified in even in this twenty twenty three it's almost twenty'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that makes me think like if if if if the if an animal get permanent damage but they don't die what do they do with them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think they just burns'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i'm sure they put them down'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i would assume they would kill them yeah that was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh you see no that that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'give them them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a harsh way to put that but yeah they would put them down'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they put them down there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that that would be my guess'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes that would be my guess too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because they're there's gonna be something going on with them after the testing you know to make them not normal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the reactions needed the post post test reaction so that would be even more dangerous yeah who knows'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then do you see those are the sad part because the animal didn't choose to be part of the experiment was forced and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i was just gonna say that umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's exact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but and another this is from peta so i mean they might have juiced the numbers up a little bit but they say more than a hundred and ten million animals each year are killed in testing that seems like a too high of a number to me but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it did not want'",
        "'speaker_2': 'say that number again'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but more than that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a hundred and ten million'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'holy cannoli'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i cannot imagine my'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh my'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that is in the whole world only news'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this is in US laboratories'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh just in the united states'",
        "'speaker_4': 'only to say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's a lot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i don't that's it yeah that that seems very very high obviously peters one goal is to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to stop some i see another another one around five hundred thousand suffer and die so it might be suffering and dying they're trying but still that seems way too high compared to some of these other numbers i've seen i think i think it's in the hundreds of thousands but i don't think it's maybe over a million but not a hundred and ten'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'peter is very aggressive with their mission'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some apps are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it according this there there is i again this is another like animal rights number but they say a hundred to two hundred thousand will suffer and die from cosmetic testing around the world every year so i didn't know cosmetic testing was still that big of a thing but i guess if it is if china like you have to test cosmetics i know we have a lot of cosmetics to probably come from china that might be a big source'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah for sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know in this debate someone someone ask why why not test on human volunteers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'instead of one was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah why not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that way i think the testing would go forever down'",
        "'speaker_4': 'after after protests'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you humans have to volunteer to go to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but not even even in the lawsuit they have to go through'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the cannot protest and even they cannot file a case so why not animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i don't get the idea but where did the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i have a i have a friend who'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when when did they get the idea of testing into the the nearest genes to a human i mean the nearest animal that that that's that's close to a human ohh who who who had this first idea i think he should be hanged first'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it does and in and you know now people people i i've seen like in in my my quickly they've seen people arguing that it's not correct animals are not close to to humans and that's why most sensed fail'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's not but almost yeah right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that there there's still a big failure rate even if they succeed in animals yeah there there's still a big failure rate transferring might it might succeed in mice and then you do the human trials and it didn't work and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at this time failing because yes animals are not the same'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah because the yeah the you humans are very different from animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'solving whatever'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's too different'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then i heard for the for the in response to this concerns many organization and government have established a regulations and guidelines'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to govern the use of animal testing i mean like for example in for for for example in the european union animal testing is regulated by european union detective so i mean so it it might be there as well in the US as well so but still there i i don't know whether they are maintaining their standards or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean to what extent they are maintaining their requirement or specifications i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it's there the ruling that they can test this amount of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and who would follow up with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh animals per year or something like that i don't know whether they're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh following the rules'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and that's that's probably something that's hard to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as far as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hard to track and and do it i mean you have to put a lot of money and a lot of you know effort into making sure every single lab is doing what they're saying is i don't think it's hard to get lab mice and it's not like that's something that's tracked down my you're buying and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's hard'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'everything'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because they have to keep the learning'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and and as you're saying it it is actual boiling down to the money issue you know using animals it is easier getting mices or you know grooming mices it's so easy than buying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm tubes and and and dig the cells of humans and put them in the chips probably that technology is expensive then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but why do we get so many mices'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah exactly and you know and you know in my sense reproduce without like a lot of effort so you get to get more of them for free'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they reproduce'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my sister'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so fast when when a human is near them you cannot even see them but i don't know how come the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how how come they get into the testers hands so easily'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm sure a lot of them are breeding though the mice and the like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they breed them yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'probably they go the first batch and then they are breeding them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and maybe selling them to other labs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that's my feeling'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like that that is a is kind of a sad thought that you were the the animal was born just to be experimented on and then die that that's its entire life'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's kind of sad like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and disposed yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like are you sad yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the the purpose in life it seems'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so when you think of it that's sad'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's so sad actually yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i don't wanna end it on a sad note like that but we do have our our time in so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah although this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh debate or whatever you say for the sake of this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh discussion but it's really sad actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah we'll we'll see i i think it'll keep it'll keep evolving in the the future where there will be less and less and but yeah we'll see but not appreciate you guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hope so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's it's important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh i appreciate you guys uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh sorry i was just gonna say yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'since sorry i i'm so sorry yeah so sorry i was just gonna say i think it's a really important thing to talk about i don't think it gets talked about enough cause you know we're all going on about our lives every day and this is like the last thing on our minds you know we're all worried about our own lives but this is actually happening it's very real so i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go ahead if you want to put one last name'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's happening and and they will think that only animal activists knows this and that deal with this but for for us no more i mean normal people like we are not uh animal activist so we are not animal researchers we don't know anything about that really i didn't i i wasn't even i didn't even care until when i got this topic and i was like ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly right and i realize it's right now that it's really sad actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i'm saying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how could people do that even in twenty twenty three i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly alright well guys i'm uh we are finished up here so i'll make sure everything gets submitted you guys get your payments but yeah definitely appreciate the conversation i think it was good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah thank you thank you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it was great actually thank you so much guys'",
