        "'speaker_1': 'hello welcome'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so let's start this off with a with a quick sound check so joel could you please start by saying the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two quick round fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes very good thank you uh shrada please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes please say the sentence the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh shorter are you are you wearing a headset'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah a layered hurts her'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm OK very nice thank you and uh shall i call you ready or or or should tanya'",
        "'speaker_3': 'titanium would be nice'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK chatton yeah could you say the sentence please the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'chef daniel what about you are you wearing a headset because your your voice is kinda i don't know it's it's a it's slightly echoing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cartoons OK then just give me a second i'll be back with a wired headset'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes please thank you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah i'm back home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK perfect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is this is this better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes sounds very good thank you very much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh just to remind you today's topic is is animal testing justified and before we start i would like to encourage you to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh to chip in in agreement like say OK or or disagree or or if you have interrupt someone while someone is talking to ask a question to further clarify so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so overlaps in voice and interruptions are a welcome i mean everybody should take their turns of course but if that happens to have a lively conversation to have a lively debate then please don't hesitate to do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK perfect'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so uh is animal testing justified UM i'm gonna go ahead and take one pro position does anybody volunteer to take the pro side with me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah would agree to be OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah OK so so do you have any preference which side to take'",
        "'speaker_3': 'authorized'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i guess that is someone who wants to go for a pros so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no problem you can do it as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so i will go for constant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK fine thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so shadani you gonna go uh for cons as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's fine with me i'm good yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK cool then joel and me pro and shade and katanya for cons alright very good so does anybody like to start'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would like to go first so yeah so i did some digging about the animal testing and for scientific research so i feel that you're we really must acknowledge that certain kinds of animal research involves subjecting creatures to what can aptly be described as torture so i'm very sure that some of you must have seen the videos of cute beagles being forcefully'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes please'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'me to inhale the cigarette smoking you know just to do the testing on effect on their lungs and brain and rather all other organs but i feel that there are people out there you know who are willingly smoking smoking in public smoking everywhere and have no intention to give it up so why not just do experiments on them rather than punishing or torturing these animals you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i totally agree with shraddha because this this is just not only about the animal testing in general my perception is that we are trying to use'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some kind of results which we get from this animal testing and then trying to trying to make products for humans which can which again need to be tested on us so why don't we rather try you know directly being tested on humans at a basic very basic front and then try to see how the body adapts or changes because that would actually give us more good results in identifying the products which are very appropriate for the human'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'usage as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but how are we gonna find out uh if the initial testing on a human is not gonna be a a let's say highly detrimental or highly dangerous'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but that's something which i think we will have to nowadays i think with the new technology or new enhancements in science we are even able to replicate you know meat like or you know plants meat and everything so i'm sure we should be able to find a way to do that and we can probably replicate a small organs from you know i think we can if i'm not wrong we are already using the stem cells to regrow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well at least partial organs why don't you why why don't we use them directly to you know test these you know products i would rather say and then see how the results are so you're not actually using a human and you do not need to worry about OK killing an organ which you just created out of somebody 's steps and so that's that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and to add to chaitanya 's uh point i would also like to say that you know there is a report of peta where they have mentioned some promising human relevant research methods such as organs on chips sophisticated users of human stem cells genomics and proteomics imaging and computer modeling et cetera to replace the animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would definitely say that there are today there are alternatives to animal testing but they definitely are way more cost intensive than just testing it on animals and now to the day today we don't have the capabilities to do a large scale testing with like a create like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah not artificial'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with artificial organs so that's why i think that maybe this will be a solution in the future but right now considering the costs we definitely won't be able to just go and use this solution'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a church could you reduce the background noise a little bit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'shark yeah yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes thank you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with good joel 's point i i guess there are bit controversies on this because joel don't you think that having a laboratory with your testing stuff and computers is anytime better than having a laboratory with animals and their cages and in fact all the supplies that are required for their'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'living or breeding whatever you can call them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm not defending that they are like that they are using animals that's definitely not good but right now at the point where we are at we aren't capable to do the amount of testing we need with the same budget we have so of course you're right it would definitely be better if you could use like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'non animal not animals or some kind of artificial organs something in that way so we don't harm any kind of animal but we aren't able to replicate that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cost effectively that's why i don't think it's a viable solution at the moment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i feel that's where the government comes in and they are at fault because you know still the forty seven percent of the budget of national institutes of health which is basically allotted for these types of research is again being transferred or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'funded to animal experiments you know and which they can very effectively use to do the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh like organs on chips and other computer based AI based research stuff but they are just not willing to do it i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but i think to just to counter joel i understand yes we do not have the technology or the amount of money which you would like to spend on creating artificial organs but i think even or if let's say suppose we're trying to test a cancer drug which is probably one of the ones you know they've been fine trying to find the perfect cancer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'talk to make go away with the cancer itself but unfortunately a lot of times when they start testing in on animals it shows positive results or their they extrapolate the data and say yeah it will work with humans but when they do it first testing on the humans itself and it feels very drap badly then all the money which you have actually put into the research is down the drain so which is also not a very good sign'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in terms of how much money you're actually spending on trying to test it on animals and saying that OK we can use it on humans but that's also money wasted if if the truck doesn't even go through the first round of testing itself so that's something which i feel can be diverted towards creating the artificial or you know human like organs so that we can directly test it on the biological cells which actually are going to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'taking off consume this medicine so that's my take on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so i i definitely see your point but one other thing that comes up of course we can like test on artificial organs but with them we can't replicate what it does to our brain or to the animal 's brain so of course you can see how it directly influences the tissue or something like that but you can see how it influences the brain and its cells and how the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah the the subject or the animal will react to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the substance or whatever you're testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh and uh i might add to that since being on the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on the pro side here so i'm gonna put out something rather controversial i guess so in order to save millions if not billions of human lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'why shouldn't you do a animal testing first because i i think that if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if any other species would be the dominant race here on earth that they would do anything to ensure their survival too so so why shouldn't we to save more human lives not do animal testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah definitely i would like to add on that point that we're talking about testing so we can like benefit the human race without harming and any humans and while we're discussing if animal testing is cruel we still are consuming'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tons and millions of tons of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'flesh and animal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'animals everyday yes so i don't think that when we're thinking about regulating that we should maybe first look at other areas where there's way more cruelty going on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's again another case of cruelty out there and i would say not everyone is a non vegetarian person but i would also like to add that you know animals are artificially infected with all these diseases that the scientists want to test on while there are patients out there who somehow already got impacted and maybe they are on some very extreme verse where their disease is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is like taking over their life so a scientist i feel with their concerned with governments concerned can actually try their new medicines on these patients who are actually affected and who actually need this solution and rather than affecting this or torturing these animals externally like giving them this disease which they could have naturally never'",
        "'speaker_4': 'contracted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'kind of coming back to your point where yes cruelty yeah as you said we are the largest species hence trying to or making ourselves survive but at the end of the day if you see how much of these animals are being sacrificed in terms of there being bread only for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the testing purpose itself there are just a breed of mices which are you know they are just born and they're just dying in the laboratories which also actually kind of puts a question on how are we supporting the ecology or the environment itself so because we are causing a lot of side effects or we have seen across the place that there is ecological balance which goes down and which ultimately again proves to the same point that if we don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maintain the balance of the ecology then yeah the there might be some species which get extincted altogether and it was probably one of the important ones and probably we are derailing ourselves in not having a sustained or a better life that's my point i would like to add'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so daniel would you say that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well uh here on this side being against animal testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but UM there should also be uh reforms for areas like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh breeding'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let's say cattle for consumption or other animals so does that go in the same category as animal cruelty as animal testing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes i would totally agree with what you just asked i myself being a vegetarian or mostly a vegetarian i do not i do not actually accept the killing of you know a lot of cattle or even for that sake chicken or even turkey for the reason that it needs to be consumed and seeing the trends myself over the last couple of years is that a lot of people have actually started moving away from this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no meat eating or let me say consuming meat on our daily basis towards i would say consuming the plant based aspects currently i'm in germany so i can see that from the past eight years because i was here back eight years back and i can see that the trend has actually changed a lot where we can actually see people consuming a lot less meat trying to go for much healthier options in terms of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'going for your vegetables or your even your vegan stuff that's a new trend and equally people agreeing or opening restaurants which is you know actually reducing the amount of cattle getting killed every day and i'm sure you must all of us have seen videos of how actually cattle are killed for you know getting these meat as well or even for the sake pigs or swine as we call it in germany because these things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are actually killed in a very cruel way and being in india and we we we kind of have this thought process that whatever the animal sees before it dries or you know there's the that memory and those things actually get get on to you and you know it those emotions are passed on to you through the food as well so that actually you know kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the forms need to come but unfortunately most of the european or american side they consume a meet a lot and due to this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it might not be very easy but i definitely see it coming probably in let's say in the next twenty five to thirty years because personally what i've experienced in the lot last eight years in germany itself it actually gives me a lot of hope that yes we might see a day where actually governments would be talking about even animal testing as well as consumption for me to be very restricted activity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'adding to chaitanya 's point yeah so you know i have been associated with some organizations or institutions where they actually took initiative to stop this cruelty and i would like to highlight your or rather give a good shout out to the institute where i was studying in india their job was basically just to teachers just to give us degrees but apart from that they had this strict no meat rule in our college and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'excuse me i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there were a few days where we used to organize no meatless day where we took rallies on the roads and educated people on how cruel it is to kill someone who has equal rights as us to live on this planet and you have better options to it obviously which so yeah there are some institutes who are taking initiatives and efforts to promote such type of good deeds to stop cruelty'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would definitely agree on your points that if we are able to reduce animal suffering and to reduce the killing of animals we should definitely do that but coming back to a point i said before at the moment right now we're not able to recreate a whole functioning human body'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's why we can't really see how it's gonna affect the human body because of course you can replicate one organ or maybe two organs but you can't see how you how they are gonna affect each other because we got to see our whole body as a big ecosystem and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all of it affects each other and those effects just can't be seen if we do it out of a whole organism'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i agree but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK there might be some scientific research or there are some which cannot be you know adequately done without animals but at least what laboratories can do is improve the well being of laboratory animals or by you know they can just provide good environment for them rather than just keeping this animals closed into cage and leaving them without painkillers after doing the research so they can just improve their environment at least'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at least what they can do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i think uh just to joel yes i agree with you that we cannot read you know completely replicate the the reactions what the the testing actually brings on a human or even for that sake on the animals itself but i think until and unless somebody doesn't start stepping towards it it's going to be a difficult task to achieve even let's say down the line in hundred years because i i say this because we have already starting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to talk about using artificial intelligence to actually design medicines and you know of course all this information which is required or which needs to be put in for this algorithms to actually design these drugs is already still in a very infant or an ascent phase and all the information until for this is actually coming from the existing animal testing which is currently happening which is acceptable but i think we should also start looking into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all other various possibilities of doing this and i shared that mentioned during during her you know one of the initial statements is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have to actually we are giving artificially these diseases to these animals it's not that they get it naturally i think the best example is that last two years we have gone through the whole pandemic and that exactly shows us that how different are we from the animals on which we are taste testing them yes we have a lot of DNA which gets shared from our whole origin but i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the there is a lot of difference between them and us and i see that a lot of money actually gets wasted which doesn't get reported by a lot of companies a lot of the pharmaceutical companies because they don't like to sell that or or mention that you know we spend so much money but yeah we have to throw it down the drain so that would be something which is very interesting in this aspect and until and unless we don't step the alternate path we would always stick to the same path because it's easier'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's available and you can do it and see OK this is the results which we can get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah definitely but when we take a look at the pandemic so it was a whole new thing happening in disease that was as it was then unknown to us and we didn't have a viable solution for it and we had to use a new type of of vaccine and that already was yeah that already was a big risk i would say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because it was such a new thing and if we then would have tried it with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things we aren't like we aren't used to if we would have tested it maybe on artificial organs or on maybe some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'other thing not animals we would have more worry tables that we didn't know how they would like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'produce or create what outcome they would create so i think there are some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'areas where you shouldn't involve more risks than they're already is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and UM uh so elaborating on on joel 's point i i think it's a good point that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh that we can't know how uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how a specific human organ is gonna react inside of a whole organism and unless we do the testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh on a full organism and chaitanya has'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh earlier mentioned that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i believe that china you said that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the with a newer technology that it would be possible to test it on humans rather safely but let's say that we're not at this stage and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we would have to test it on a whole organism as joel pointed out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but we don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they know the risks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'involved so uh shrada and titania on the on the con side do you have any suggestions on how to solve this issue without testing it on animals but having just as good as results'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh i think at this point of time we do not have major alternatives to be truthful to you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think technology is catching up that's my own personal perspective because i work in one of those or i work with a huge service provider company but looking at the the trends and the clients especially in pharmacy pharmaceutical areas or even going towards the clients who are actually working on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because animal testing is not only for pharmacy so it is all or pharmaceutical drugs it's also for your makeup which we use across the fashion industry and typically fashion industry or they do not actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they do not have any other option they would rather test it on animals because that would exactly show immediately how or reaction of a product happens on these animals or you know that's something like that but i think at least my perspective or what the trends i've been reading is that we are going towards using more technology in terms of developing very complex models or very complex products which will allow us to actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'try to you know bring up the scientific part of it towards more on a computer based aspect and then you know actually let the scientist or create their own drugs and you know use it for printing and you know try to see if i use a human like aspects or human itself in the in artificial world can we actually see what reactions do happen to them so you know trying to play around with the chemical structures and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then trying it on the artificial humans or artificial programs that helps to see how the models come out or how the the the product can be so yeah it's it's it's already happening i would say but yeah it would take quite some time where it is mastered or available for all these pharmaceutical companies or even the fashion industry for that sake that to move away completely from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the animal testing and coming to birds this kind of this is also one of the goals this is also one of the goals which i think is set for our sustainability aspect where we have been asked to of course lot of us only talk about reducing the carbon print but i think this is something which is also really already on the global mind where the less you kind of create these'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no testing sites or all these things because they are also carbon producers and they even though even in a small way they actually support your carbon generation so i think this is also something which is already on the global plate and hopefully all the countries who are working towards sustainability sustainable aspects then i think they will also work towards making this go away in a couple of years so that's my person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes meat consumption has a very high carbon footprint that is correct i have very high emission'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know uh sure i know you want you wanted to add something to that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah yeah i just wanted to say that like jet and mentioned one thing that can be done to replace animals is that human volunteers like i mentioned previously people who are willingly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'been involved'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohk OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh want to participate in this research and want to try these medicines so i guess that can be also a point because i know some of the people who have volunteered for HIV and aids medicine testing and trust me when they obviously like everyone knows that when they tested it on animals it was a hundred percent failure but when they tested on humans now few people are getting the their yearly report'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's a yearly report which HIV and aids affected people have to do just to know if the virus is still active in their body so after going through all the treatment and research and medicines now they actually get the reports like the viruses not detected or viruses not found in dead body so you know this is again a good alternative to use instead of animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm and yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would definitely support that point but i think we have been focusing on like testing on animals for human medicine or human products solely but we shouldn't forget that lots of animal testing is also done for the benefit of animals because lots of testing yeah is is done for like certain vaccines or certain medication that animals are using and and just don't forget how how many animal lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'probably have been safe just because those new vaccines or medicines have been tested on animals and i think that has definitely had a great impact also on the way how our cattle is evolving of course also in the negative way but it has made lots of things far more effective and secure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i feel you just justified my point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but i think i think that's that's would be anyway required because we have a lot of diseases which are getting involved in animals as well so for them it's the same way like shorter said i think it would be better for us to test whatever humans are going through through on humans and animals have to go through their own this thing but i think the amount of percentage which we do them on animals would be restricted very highly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now we are kind of using a you know a whole big lot of population for various activities or various testings and i think if we are just doing testing on animals for their own vaccinations or for their own health and i think the population or the amount of testing would be very less and that should be acceptable because that would not as i said previously it would not destroy your balance of the ecology or it would not have any negative impacts on the environment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK all right we're already at the end here so thank you for participating thank you so much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'welcome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i wish you all a great weekend'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you too thank you very much bye bye'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah thank you you too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah thank you bye bye'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thank you bye bye'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'"
