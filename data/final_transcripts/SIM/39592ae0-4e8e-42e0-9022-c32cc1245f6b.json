        "'speaker_1': 'biggest uh'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i definitely i definitely think that's a a con for unemployment i mean the jobs that are considered like routine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're going to eventually get automated with AI'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i mean that's a that's one con of a lot of pros'",

        "'speaker_1': 'um it depends what type what you have is they're taking over cause safety could be a concern especially in some like say auto places or just like you know maybe where humans don't need to be as close to certain things like certain tools and whatnot i'm sorry but i'd rather have it do it for me if i can find something else'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'weeks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know more creative in the same field yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right those risky jobs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right and then you still have to have people to have maintenance on that technology so it's still a job it's just not as many'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you guys get it exactly and that's like who i mean who do you think creates these devices'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's not robots creating to the robots or at least it shouldn't be if that's the case then you know i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean you'd think of jobs like you know going out into space or like stuff like that like that stuff that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know a i we have to depend on AI for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because we've had how many people go out into space'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's all about limitation it's all about limitations in my opinion artificial intelligence'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is a bit like life it's all about limits and if you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you overstep the limits'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i agree'",

        "'speaker_3': 'and i did'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that did uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah they they learned to say something i'm sorry i think it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh no i said i just think they're certain limits we shouldn't cross'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and that's i mean i'd i'd much rather i mean we don't wanna see anything destroyed but i'd much rather see a robot destroyed than something happened to a person because at least robots can be you know replaced everybody every one of us is special in our own ways so we couldn't be if that makes you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but guys guys here's a here's a here's a notion the technology that we're using now is teams'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm like i don't know how you guys are i'm thirty nine but like twenty years ago this wasn't possible but we're from all corners of the globe speaking to each other via technology which is complementing our lives i think that AI needs to complement our lives but not replace our lives'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everyone'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree i agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right or control it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we should control the technology not it control us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'control'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there has to be the the the the master always in my opinion has to be us as humans otherwise'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's the point in the world what's the point in planet earth'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right they think it's going to become some fear that it's going to become fully automated it's like well we gotta stop it from doing that you're right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so control and limitations i yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but think about like he said with microsoft teams like daniel said uh you know this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'program now is able to like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you've been able to record stuff for a while but you know there are other various options to help with these meetings and think about how quick recordings can be available even if they're not just on your own device like this is automatically saving this to the web somewhere after running a program on my computer and i don't even have to upload it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so think about how much that has even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just think that like with the technology that we have at the moment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like i'm speaking to dakota lauren and nicole without this technology that we have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i probably never would have spoke to you guys um and all of your opinions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'should be values and personally from my perspective our valued so i think it's a beautiful thing that we have technology as i stress again that complements our lives'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the dark side of it is as i as i reiterated before is when it can potentially take over our lives when an event like this could be run with nonhumans'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think that's really sad prospect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because that just be boring like with the meeting especially you know like why would you want a robot talking to you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because we all have to have it yeah i hadn't that's that's what's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i never thought about it like that either'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know interesting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'interesting yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but when when you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right because limitations come with technology i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'somebody just asked something did lauren just asked something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what was that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh i said that limitations come with technology'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can never be stressed enough'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which i also think is another like dark downside of it is that people are worried more about their like privacy and all of that stuff that comes with AI so that's i mean that's another down part but on the other hand i mean you think about like people with disabilities and all that that stuff mean AI has helped with that tremendously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i really i i completely agree nicole i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that it's it's really really good that people with disabilities or blindness can be assisted by technology and AI and and like i said it it complements their lives and makes their lives better and in many ways it expands the life that they already have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm but like just out of interest does anyone enjoy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or get anything out of speaking to a boss in relation to if they call a call center or they're trying to do something on the internet and they're speaking with a bot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'does anybody get any fulfillment or enjoyment i personally don't but i'd be interested to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you mean like those chat they say it's a live chat and then it says hi i'm the chat bot it's like live chat with a bot huh well yes i'm alive but you are not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean it could be just like talking to some humans they might not understand what you're trying to tell them well i mean maybe that's just a you know like you know what i mean like sometimes it's you know hard to understand but it's you know i think it's easier to you said you don't get enjoyment i actually think it's easier talking to humans as well because then you can actually base your point and maybe you know it's not just i feel that you're talking about this let me lead you to somebody it's like well i should have talked to somebody in the first place'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree i i agree to code it because like like when you're talking to a bot they come out with like five six seven eight questions that are preconceived preconceived OK it's like anybody that wakes up in the morning and says how's your day do you ever say it's a standard day what what is a standard day it doesn't exist does it i mean in my life it doesn't every day is never standard no matter what you do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what is on your schedule for today at nine forty eight AM and thirty seven seconds let's see put this in this data sheet here no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you still there lauren'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm here i was just listening'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright well feel free to feel free to speak up if you have any comments because we're all here to we're all friends here we're all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because i wasn't sure if you know i think i still saw you in the participant list but i wanted to make sure it wasn't any tech issues or anything like you're free to you got in the have you had any experience yourself with these chats especially like what experience with AI have you personally had if i may ask'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah well i actually had a job not too long ago maybe like two three years ago where i was working on AI software dealing with siri so it's it's interesting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to see how dependable we've made technology and i i don't think it's a good idea because within those two to three years i've seen how it's increased significantly like everywhere i go everybody has their phone in their hand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no matter what age really and it's surprising i think the only age group that probably doesn't is seventy plus those are the only ones that can put if they have a cell phone they can put their phone down and walk away without a problem'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but the rest of us know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's very true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the panda way too much on IR'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree completely yeah it's the the the the older generation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in my on this side of the world i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'don't don't engage to the same degree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that i do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm in my thirties obviously i don't know what what age range you guys are but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'technology is heavily influenced on my age range'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm twenty nine myself i'm you know so i'm i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mine too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm a young and here i suppose no i i i don't know i'm you know i've been using it since like i think first grade'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which was like two thousand for me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i've actually been on technology now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah same i'm thirty five so yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will see i'm the youngest one that everybody'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry say that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'another'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i said i'm the youngest out of everybody i'm twenty eight'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well hey there's nothing wrong with that i mean hey that just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know so i feel like i kinda came into the world at the beginning of the lot more use of technology'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like but it's sad and i say that's like because you guys said like not being able to put phones down or people just depend on them way too much i don't know if you guys know this but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah how many'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm curious to know how many kids even these days and this is somewhat joking but somewhat serious'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how many know what a pencil is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i have nephews that like as in like first grade and second they had tablets given to them at their school'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i can i can i can agree with that dakota my my daughter is five years of age and she knows what a pencil is and she can write and she's really into art and drawing but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'she can use my mac'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and she's got a tablet in school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but she she can work her rim work her way around my mac just by what they teach her in school and she's five'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i was a teacher for ten years'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i just recently'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stepped away from the classroom but that was huge in the classroom i was a third grade teacher so i'm teaching up like you know eight nine year olds and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they all know i mean they have to know how to use technology because there's so much stuff that we do in education that these kids have to they just have to have know it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and i can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know i gotta say that it has helped me even though i never had a tablet in school because i graduated back in twenty eleven and that was before they technically started even allowing like i was lucky i had a laptop in school in middle school and high school and now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm because i had a laptop in school i was allowed to have it there but i was probably the only student who did because it's funny you mentioned blindness earlier i'll tell you guys all right now i'm running this microsoft teams through my screen reader i am actually blind myself and i am not afraid of admitting it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh wow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i'm not letting the blindness stop me at all because i have been told that sometimes i can do stuff better than those that are fully sighted and i can catch scammers in their own game like you know speaking of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you shouldn't be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hundred percent agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because like the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry to call dakota i wasn't clear on what you said you said you're you're running teams on a on a what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm using my screen reader i'm not even looking at my screen right now because i can see a little bit but not enough to which the screen reader you know like it's telling me the buttons that i'm on and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'voice assisted yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah no not this one this is actually you know on the computer in general it's just telling me it is you know telling me like talking but i don't have to tell it what to do right now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh i actually have that device'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right and he hovers over buttons it'll tell him what it is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i said as you hover over buttons it tells you what it is right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep as i go through them and you know think about how much spam email is sent out don't you think that that could be a i that's doing that you know like just grabbing scraping all these addresses from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know different uh media sites how do you think they get all those yes spam emails have been around'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but how you can definitely tell it tries to beat people at their own game but i've beat people at theirs because i've gotten an email from amazon zero N dot com my reader told me M is zero and dot com'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to somebody that cited that looks like amazon'",
        "'speaker_3': 'amazon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and my reader could tell that it was a different character'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so i mean i blindsided the scammer in their own game as far as i'm concerned'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh you know they got blindsided by the blind man and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i don't i don't get offended if anybody jokes about it just so you guys but yeah like it's helped me so yes i depend on stuff a little more like the technology but it's because i kind of need to to say for example run these'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so you can appreciate it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i'm sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i think i think that's one of the sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a real'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh sorry nicole no you go ahead nicole you were first'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i was just saying that i think that that's one of the biggest benefits to AI is is the tech the advancements in technology in i guess not just medical but i don't know how it's helping us like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm like i'm a really really big advocate of technology and the job that i do i work as an airline pilot and i fly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'america 's finest boeing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a brilliant brilliant company um'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we've got a system on the airplane which has been there for about twenty five years and it's called autoland and it basically means that in really really low visibility where it's not possible for us to manually land the aircraft and the aircraft will land itself under our supervision so we tell it what to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it lands itself and it does the physical bit of landing it but we need to be there to tell it what to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that side of technology'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is brilliant and it's really really safe it's safer than anything'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so many things that you can everyday tasks that you think are are pretty safe it's actually safer so on that side of technology'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'AI if you wanna call it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's brilliant i i really am an advocate of it and that's why this question for me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the the the the topic of this meeting is for me such an open question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right because what you said goes hand in hand with when we control it instead of letting it control us we come out better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely lauren the airplane will not all the land itself it needs to be told what to do and it will do it but we need to be there two of us in the flight deck to tell it what to do otherwise it won't do it it's not possible for it to do it on its own'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it could potentially eventually go that way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe at the maybe at the end of my lifetime i would say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that i was going to say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i could i think it's a real conceivable thing that it could happen but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in this moment we manipulate what it does'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it does things that we physically can't do via our senses and like in my job when i land in aircraft'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all my senses are there my hearing my balance my sight i need all of those otherwise i can't do it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but when i lose those i visual references when there's low visibility of lost one sense which is the most important the aircraft can replace that sense by me manipulating it but i'm the master and that's where i'm an advocate of of AI it complements my job'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it complements safety and there it stops for me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would say too so i'm no pilot but just like i had read that it helps with productivity AI helps with productivity as in like it does tasks'",
