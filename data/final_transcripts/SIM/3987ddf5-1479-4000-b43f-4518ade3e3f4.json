    "Is animal testing justified?": [
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and that will be your moderator today and before we start the we're gonna start this conversation we would need to test our audio systems'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so please say the phrase the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then we can go to the discussion yeah OK the do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anybody else'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the quick'",
        "'speaker_3': 'brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and john'",
        "'speaker_1': 'could you please i i think you're on mute'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please say the phrase'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that works great thank you so the topic of our discussion today is animal testing justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do any of you have like a really strong opinion on this subject'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i believe uh animal testing is not justified because they have it's like testing if someone would test the same things on us then we would not like it just because we cannot feel how the animal feels'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we a few people may think that it is justified so as as far as i'm concerned i think it is not justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK anybody else'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's justified in the sense to be honest because there's a lot of things that we can't really test on humans because it's risking a human life and i'm not saying that animals lie animal lies on precious but then it's it's really important to draw a line over there because for example if it's an animal that's an abundance that's not on the verge of extinction for example mice or rats things like that i think i think it's justified in a sense it's better than risking a human life in that sense because the the potential i'm not seeing destroy the ecosystem and all of that but of course in in a certain limited amount of way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's really important test some things on animals before putting them out back into the human population because here the stakes are really high and if people lose lives the companies might have to incur huge amounts of damages and huge amounts of costs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK that that that makes sense what about you john'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think you're still on mute'",
        "'speaker_1': 'john you still unmute'",
        "'speaker_1': 'could you please unmute yourself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well while we are i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'waiting for john to unmute himself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i mean i i'm kind of on the fence here because i can see both sides of this i mean on one side we really really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know kind of benefit from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'animal testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know the many diseases that we can cure now many you know products that supposed to be tested somehow and hopefully not in humans you know they should be tested'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but at the same time you know aren't we are now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's interesting can you hear me now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh OK john yeah i can hear you now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'homes i'm very sorry i think that i think it's interesting there's an irony there that people that don't want to use animals for testing will still eat animals for food and so i think there's a basic life stance that is things are here in the world for us to use and we should use them versus we are here sharing this thing and whether or not to use animals in medical testing is only one example of the way that we take advantage of animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK i mean that that that that's a good kind of strong position about like you know some people are against you consumption or you know damaging any animals and you you're kind of like that if we are using animals we should use in them on a full scale right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but if you're if you're eating a steak you're taking advantage of an animal in the same way as if your animal testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i wouldn't follow the same but but yeah i do agree it is to some extent i do agree to the one because i'm vegetarian and i do get the point of it like i'm i'm OK if you test like some drugs and animals but then i just would never eat it i understand like the irony of it and it looks very hypocritical but then it's just that the benefits and the costs are really big with animal testing whereas with eating it's not as much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i have something to say here that whenever we test anything on any living creature it can be a human or animal what i believe is that if i want to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who say if if if i say that something is hot or something is cold then i can feel it only when it is applied to my body now when we are conducting a test on an animal which cannot communicate back to us in the same language as a human would do we would never know what the animal is going through now we are talking to each other but the animal will not be able to talk back to us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the best example is a dog uh we have pets in our home so our pets have their own unique way of communication they will not use english or any other language but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we understand them they understand us now if we need to suppose there is a new medicine or some new discovery to take care of pandemics like coronavirus and if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'excuse me i don't want to interrupt i don't mean to interrupt you but i think you you it seemed to me that you count you counter acted your own logic there because you say the animals not gonna be able to speak to us within the example that you use expressed that the dog is able to communicate with you without speaking and so it seemed to me that you use it in a non exemplar'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i know i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that is just an example like when if you i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i readers for example kent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or you know liberate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it can be any animal i don't know if you are aware of indian popular personality by the name of sadguru so i i follow his videos and in one of his videos he was asked this question by a famous indian celebrity maybe she was the reporter of NDTV which is one of the new channels in india so she was asking sadguru like what is wrong in being a non vegetarian'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so sadguru said that there's nothing wrong in eating non-veg the only thing is tomorrow if i ask you to cut your pattern it would you do that so she said no i will never do that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK this is a really long example but how does it how does it get to your point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the only thing i want to bring across is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's not how do you get to the point of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that yeah the only thing that i want to bring across is you can we as humans can conduct a test on anything but we should be sensitive to the other creature also to the other the animal on which the test is being conducted we need to be sensitive towards that animal also that is the only thing that i want to say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the topic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'does an animal so if an animal if if if you could save a pigeon 's life and a hundred people were gonna die would you still say you should save the pigeon'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that is something which i don't think i have the right answer uh someone who is very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'U M enlightened like sadhguru would be in a better position to answer that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is like asking whether would would you save your mother or your wife so it is this is a very dicey question'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohk OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so so for you it's more religious it type of the you know question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no it's not about religion the only thing is sensitivity i when i see fear or or anger or frustration in the eye of an animal it can be any animal it not only i don't know i'm not only a dog it can be any living creature if i if i see they know that now i'm going to die someone is going to cut my throat so they are living in a constant fear like OK this am i dead now or am i dead two after two minutes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm well sure yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it just seems to me it just seems to me that it just seems to me that it's it's too easy to say you shouldn't do that to animals and then say you know i'm not able to answer the question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two minutes later'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that is just my point of view everyone has their own point of view so what i wanted to say is that uh if we can find a way a better way without testing on animals it would be great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i don't think there is a better way to be honest because what about all these medicines that are just for example the covid vaccine right now if the covid vaccine a lot of them were so so much like they they were just outright it was just it was not even scientific most of them and what they had to do what vaccines have to do is go through like a three phase clinical trial and that's when they get out in the public now what if these unscientific vaccines that whatever company produced in whatever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in whatever country would like whatever chemicals that they use to bring it up what if that poisoned humans are you saying that that we would rather poison humans than animals because about about about a thousand or two thousand would have died if that clinical trial took place on humans rather than animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this is a very good example that you have given about covid vaccines even after testing i don't know whether they have tested on some animal or not but as far as my country india is concerned i'm it was constantly in the news that we will ask people to volunteer to get themselves you know to allow us to test this vaccine on them and if it is successful then we will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they did'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'offer it to the whole population now i don't know what research has been going behind the scenes but then ultimately the point was we need to test it on humans'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's taking that excuse that's taking that that's taking your argument pretty far into pretty far field now you're now you're saying that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh through through volunteers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because of the vaccine didn't work and something terrible happened it's you're you're saying that human life and pigeon life is at the same level'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i believe every life is equal uh i don't think that humans are above'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah some frog or some dog or some ant or some pigeon life is life it can be in any form so it would be unfair to say that we as humans are superior to someone to a specie which cannot communicate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh which cannot talk'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that is and that is the that is an individual that is an individual belief system of yours and there are other people in the world feel like that the things were put on the earth air for man to take advantage of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes of course yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's actually super interesting that you know we're having such'",
        "'speaker_1': 'different kind of backgrounds here with the very different understanding of life'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because my life cannot be yeah my life cannot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hi i'm sorry for interrupting my life yeah yeah yeah my life my life cannot be more precious than someone else 's life as far as humans are concerned i also believe my life is my life and the life of an aunt living in my house is has equal importance because i am not giving life god has given life to everyone there is some some ant or some dog or some pigeon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no no but please please interrupt'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'around my house everybody has the same life like what we believe and yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wait'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we can just wait what what about micro organisms like viruses and bacterias and you know for example the covered viruses that causes a cocos covid yeah they live in you it hasn't got us give them life too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah to be fair we could argue that yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this is a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yeah to answer your yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes a very interesting question'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and your immunity system is actually brutally killing them this beautiful you know poor poor microorganisms'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'very very very interesting question and this answer is coming from sadguru not from me because i have heard this in one of his videos somebody asked him about the corona virus so somebody asked him like yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'excuse me sir check on that on that basis of logic on that basis of logic should animals not eat other animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we'll come to that please allow me to finish this so sadguru replied that virus is also a living being and they also approach god'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh the ultimate adiyogi lord shiva they also want to live they also want to spread themselves and he he in the sense the lord shiva the adiyogi he will he he he is not partial if if if some good person goes to him he will say i bless you i or i promise in sanskrit that it says as tatas two means i promise'",
        "'speaker_4': 'excuse me they're they're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the the it's it's obviously you're it's a very beautiful and deep and rich spirituality you're discussing there but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are other there are other perspectives and i think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's important it's important to acknowledge that i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'animals yes is that john speaking yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah is that john speaking uh i think it was john's voice so yeah so john coming to your uh yeah to answer your question about animals eating animals they are designed their system their body is designed in that way one of the videos of sadguru where he was somebody asked him'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what why should i not eat non veg'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't need another i don't need another story from that same example i don't think that what i what i i i'd like to ask a question do you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do you acknowledge that there are other people that have a different opinion than yours you're saying you believe and i believe that you believe and i respect your belief do you believe that there are other people that have other beliefs that have equal merit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right yes i agree to that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK so how how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everybody has yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right so so how do we how'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how do we come to some sort of an agreement how do we how do how do we interface if if you're deeply entrenched that all animals have the same life all life has the same value and i have the view that god put things on the earth and gave me a brain and allowed me to be at the top of the chain for a reason'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do we fight not well you know what i think that all like this this argument of all all lives being equal and everything is only valid to a certain extent like if it came to to death row like when everyone was dying and you had the option of saving yourself for some some other life that is like it could be your wife or your pet or whatever you're definitely gonna save another human more than an animal isn't that true then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it depends uh i in the what happens in that moment we cannot uh decide that in advance because things keep changing all the time it's it's a dynamic environment so what will happen at that moment we don't know we need to take a decision on the spot and whatever decision we take we need to respect it because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it was uh it was the i mean to say whatever you thought is right you did now we need to respect our own actions and our own opinions'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK guys let's you know agree that we have a bit different backgrounds and it seems due to that we have rather different understanding of life and instead of the discussing you know what what's the point of it and what's the value of it let's kind of get closer to the you know discussion about the animal testing itself and let me present you a bit different point of view like on the way like everything that you have said about the testing minimals was true especially before like three hundred two hundred years ago but now we have much stronger you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'simulation abilities we have good computer scientist we can simulate many of these processes shouldn't be cut down on animal test and mostly because of that because we don't need to have you know thousands of animals tested you know something on them while we can you know run a simulation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'something'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's a very there's a very this this fifteen into something really important that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that is a better option'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's a life philosophy of mine not only in this category but in all categories whenever you're trying to accomplish something there's no need to go above and beyond what's necessary so what should be done i believe is that the the minimal amount the least restrictive thing the least painful thing the least expensive thing the the most efficient way to get to where you need to get to is where you need to go and there's no need to do more than that and so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'whatever is required if a if a if a simulate if a computer simulation can do it then that's fine provided the organization can afford the computer so it's it's whatever if i'm in that situation i'm going to do the i'm gonna save this much life as i can as much money as i can make it everybody as happy as i can but i'm gonna do what needs to get done to preserve life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right but that that's a great point what about you vertica'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and since you are a student i i hope you you are much more familiar with labs and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with sorry what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean i since you are a student i hope you are much more familiar with laboratories and it's malaysians'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean yeah i i that's the thing so like i i study psychology and i was just thinking about this topic and and animal testing and things like that obviously psychology has been bombarded with too many animal experiments and that was what psychology was until the nineteen seventies it was just experiments on pigeons and rats and chimpanzees and all of that to study human behavior and then they extrapolated it but then soon enough they realize that psychology is a science would really not progress unless there is valid data from humans'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because there is only there's only a certain extent like obviously we're not similar right even though chimpanzee share ninety nine percent of our genes and everything where we're definitely not the same on our behaviors are not the same and all of that we live in completely different environments so i do understand that yes animal testing is important in the sense that yes it helps us extrapolate it then to humans but it's also important to realize there's a huge margin of error as well in between so testing on both humans and animals will have to be necessary in order to get any drug out any medicine out any cosmetic out anyway'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it could be a safeguard animal testing could definitely be a safeguard against literally wiping out the entire human population in that sense'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well don't you contradict yourself in a way that you know first they kind of decided they're pretty different and we actually we cannot translate the results directly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you still kind of think that we need to test on them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or on on animals because even though how different they are and how not really reliable in a way you know the test results that we are getting on animals we will become will be translated to humans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i mean definitely not hundred percent and i think it's just important to realize that there is a margin of error like obviously i'm not telling everyone assumes whatever replicates on animals replicates on humans but i i think it's still important to test on animals because it's it's a huge safeguard against literally wiping the human population for testing or drug in that in that sense yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i do realize it does seem it does seem like contradictory but but i mean i feel like that is just a stance that i hold yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well we are we are humans and we should uh be UM sensitive to every species on this planet so rather than testing on on an animal we should test on ourselves'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but like guys especially like if we're going to the more moderate position and that you know there should be some testing but in certain cases but maybe not too much not too cruel and yeah like but then who decides that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean in the way for example with the drugs and everything yeah it will be the company that produces drug'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but should there be some government in the moment should it be decided by i don't know international organization'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think mostly research i think i think mostly research and i'm just getting getting obviously doing a survey of like the general population asking them what they think and then backing it up with research obviously there's gonna be backlash if for everything even if you say that it's justified if it's not justified there's gonna be backlash for every claim that you make in the world that we live in today but if if if there is a majority even by fifty one percent then forty nine then i think it should it's good enough to proceed with yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what do you think about that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i think what's implied there and what you're saying that i agree with is i don't think any this this comes anywhere near happening without government intervention i do not trust for a moment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'creations responsible for medications to do the right thing without extreme watching by outside interest groups'",
        "'speaker_2': 'may i say something uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i just wanted to uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there OK OK she should say with sagar guru is it his should it be his his decision'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'contestant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh uh well i don't think he will uh say yes to that uh but he will be the best person to answer and i just wanted to bring across one more thing which just flashed in my mind let's assume there is a i god forbid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh but let's let's assume that at the moment china is going through covid problems you must be aware of that now just assume if there is a new variant a new variant prevailing in china and it travels back to the whole world and this time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh no animal will be useful for testing because humans have already tested it on themselves now if somebody'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh some volunteer some human is says that OK i'm ready to test but the condition is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh he will not be allowed to speak'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can do whatever the hell you want but he cannot speak'",
        "'speaker_2': 'he he will not be able to tell you the amount of pain which he is feeling in his body he may cry he may die but he cannot speak what will happen what is the use of such a testing so this is what an animal goes through they cannot speak even if they die they cannot speak'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is my point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm afraid the problem there is that you know testing done not through speaking that's the kind of the main point of view that he'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean to say if if we put ourselves in the same position where we cannot speak somebody some alien is testing on humans we are humans are testing on animals some alien comes and picks up a few bunch of people from US some from india some from china and they will take us to their own world and they will start testing on us how how would we feel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think this point this point that you that you're making has been made i don't think anybody disagreeing with the point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's a little'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think but it doesn't your your stance does not resolve the messy real-world issues of the fact that we need we need cures we need medications'",
        "'speaker_1': 'distant'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so we are the best people to test because we need the medicine we need the medication so why not test on us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then what if it's poisonous what what if it what if it literally wipes out our population'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'd rather kill a rat than'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is where the government will come in that is where the government and NGO 's will come in news channels debates will come in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but how how would government would know what to do like we were testing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but the government can't protect it once we already have the drug once we already have it in our body how will the government protect us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well uh that is something which has to be which has to be done responsibly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and then and the government needs to know somehow they need to do testing too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like the the government doesn't have like a source of information they they are getting this information through some testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it has to be done'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or say let's let's say for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they they they are not divine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK let's say for example the testing will be done on somebody who is from a political background no politician will come in front and say i give my son and daughter for this testing he will always want someone else to be tested he will not allow a family member to be tested there he becomes very possessive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i i think you don't know politicians well enough i i'm sure like for political points they will sacrifice most of their family name members especially the ones they do not like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so maybe let's keep them away'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from this conversation and return to the animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean to say someone near and dear to us will be will not be offered for testing unless someone who who who is very generous will say OK i volunteer for the benefit of humanity'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just i just that's gonna i think that's going to be rare that you're going to find that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK john'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh example and i just don't understand it it in the in the final analysis what i'm hearing from you is let's kill human beings instead of rats and i just can't get my mind around that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no but the idea that there is no difference between red and human like on some divine perspective so then they or virus or you know bacterias or anything so then why to choose'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if if see if it is human who will be benefited then the test should be done on the human if animal is if if the animal will be benefited then do the test on the animal if human has to be if the ultimate beneficiary is a human being then the test must also be done on the human being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but then do you not realize that it carries a huge risk with itself like what if it's what if it's literally poison so for example there ten volunteers who come in into a drug trial right we give them this vaccine which is poisonous and it and it carries with itself or virus that is that that that literally eradicate the human population which is even worse than covid nineteen they go and spread it out to a thousand other people and the thousand other people go out spread it to a million more people so just think of it like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's the way it how what happens'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like that that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that is true but then the the manufacturer uh has to be more responsible before before giving that test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know in in the way we were actually that's what we are talking about about the responsibility and the responsibility of of what part like there there are researchers in one way there is a public there is a government there is some international organizations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the best'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is the test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but also with research right like how how would they know that's the thing like they have tried their best to make a chemical they don't know how it's gonna react in our body that's that's the problem'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who do you think OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah that that's a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well that's what we're dealing with uncertain uncertainty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is the problem but that is also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when it comes to when it comes to the point where the drawing to when it comes to the point where they're going to inject an animal i believe that has become the least restrictive thing they can do i believe they've already done their computer simulations they've done everything that they can and the only way to assure at that last step that everything is as it seems in the computer simulations is to try it on something and your suggestion of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is that is a problem'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know if it's for a human you should try it on the human i'm i don't know i mean i i i respect it i think it's a legitimate point of view in the world but i just don't i see it as a minority opinion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah no same same yeah to be fair'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it yeah did do you think guys that in general we should kind of move the development of the humankind in many ways like do you think we should kind of cut down on the animal testing and decrease amount of that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'since we have been other abilities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we should definitely cut down yeah we should definitely cut down because the moment you say animal testing is justified it will be misused left right and center'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it will be misused because no animal will no no animal will yeah no animal will go in a court of law and say that see i'm being tortured without a reason they have completed their test but because it is justified they are not stopping at it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it is justified now which is justified now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they just want to keep trying more and more for making more money because something new is always welcome to make money in the market all medicines are ultimately a product for the MNCS they want to make one million two million three million god knows how much but when you say it is justified they will misuse it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you take my taking medications'",
        "'speaker_1': 'guys please jump in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you take any medications'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yes i do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'were those medications do you think ever part of processes that involve testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm not sure i don't have any knowledge about whether it was tested on some animal or not but i have been'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that that's a good point that that's a really good point you just like i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i don't know that is the truth why i don't want to lie about it if i don't know i must admit i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what what what what would you stop taking them if you will know that they were done with some cruel animal text'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i will be the first person to stop'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like gee that they gonna get you'll just stop doing that you just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will stop doing it because i will look for alternatives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if there is no alternative'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i will look for alternative methods in ayurveda which is the indian science of medicine so there are many things many alternatives available in over there so i will look for that for a better option natural one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but it usually like has really bad you know success rate'",

        "'speaker_2': 'modern medicine is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'modern medicine is good for controlling but not eradicating the disease'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is what i believe you if you want to throw it out of the body say for example diabetes or blood pressure if you want to throw out diabetes or blood pressure then whenever i go to a doctor they will say it is incurable it is it will stay with you till you die and there is no way to throw it out of your system all you can do is control it that's it this is the final answer and i'm not really i'm not ready to take that answer i believe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there is an answer to this question and i will find it out so i i will look for alternative therapies like in ayurveda or yoga sun and there are many other better ways natural ways of getting it out of the system rather than believing what the doctor has to say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but jammed up but you haven't done that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm already doing it i'm getting results'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or you you you obviously a life so yeah that's a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm getting results but it's too early for me to disclose that maybe three months down the line i will be posting a video on facebook page and youtube channel about my weight loss so i'm i'm overweight and i'm already using alternative methods to get rid of my of the access weight'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well these these are rather different things you know that we are not i don't think anybody tests you know weight loss'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's a different'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK that that that that this is strong position uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then what if it's a life or death situation what if it's a life or death situation what if it's cancer chemotherapy things like that'",

        "'speaker_2': 'in normal situation i would stop it'",
