        "'speaker_4': 'OK i'm gonna i'll go fast'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i am because i think i think they're i think they're competition and sport are quite you know they keep you healthy you learn from early and it's proven in some countries that play and sport have a better effect on children than learning too early'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so that's kind of where i stand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so so you're for for for for more sport versus the and against the nerdy kids'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah especially in the early early age'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if i talk about this topic i would really recommend children to play some sports at every age so i strongly do believe that playing sport is really important for their not for their physical growth but also it's really important for their mental growth as well so i have two kids at home and they my oldest child is really fond of playing football and he's really good in academics he's a very active child'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and he's full of energy every time so i really strong belief that yeah it's a really an important part of their growth'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree as well and it's also i think really important to learn how to be part of a team'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK what about you honey'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or if you're also on a team where it's i guess like tennis like if you're on a you know for your school you're still on a team but you're also an individual competitor so i think you know there are also sports like that but then there's also where you know soccer or in the US football it's still you have to come together as a team to work towards a common goal and i think that that's really important for children to learn that's not in a traditional school setting and also again mental physical health and development is really important as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i believe that sorry sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please i mean the idea of the interruption is great here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we we can we are trying to interrupt each other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so i would say that place playing sports is not in restricted to the schools i think child should play at home also like if you have a god or any community park we should use that and there are some sports we can play as a parent with our children so it makes our bond really stronger for an example during summer time i play badminton'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with my children and that we really enjoy as a family so i would say that y'all that's really important to increase the bond also with the family and children feel really happy they really enjoy their our company and yeah so it really increases our love towards each other so yes of course it's really important'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well it seems you are all on the same page let me oppose you like as a child i had like they were making me to play sports i absolutely hated it i hated every moment of doing that and you know i i like how everyone is like well the children are enjoying how they're playing sports and stuff i didn't enjoy it i was made to do that i still hate it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and like i really can say that you know my personal experience was that i would you know prefer to read a book or you know do something else versus playing sports anytime'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think i think you're always gonna get i think you're always gonna get people like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you know but still whether whether you you know whether whether they start refereeing umpiring whether they start just interacting still they don't actually have to face for i mean it's open to people 's choice you give them a choice and if they don't then you still find some way for them to interact you know it could be a scorekeeper it could be something like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think you know i think again it's personal choice i mean you should never force some you know if it's obvious that they don't like sports then you know it wouldn't be good and you know it wouldn't be productive to you know force them into it but there's still some way that you could still incorporate them into it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but how much choice does does the child have especially you know we are talking about rather early age like is it really a choice of the child versus the choice of their parents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think you should give them a choice i mean i give my children choice i mean my son he you know i played a lot of sport'",
        "'speaker_4': 'took quite a good level he didn't show that he had an interesting in sport we asked him he said he didn't enjoy it so you know we gave him a check we gave him a choice and funnily enough by giving him you know we gave him a choice but much later on a few years later he decided to you know he decided that he liked sport and he started doing things like martial arts and other types of you know of a sports that he that he enjoyed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then you could see it built up his confidence it built up his self esteem it built up that competitive nature in him so i mean everybody's different obviously but that's my parenting you know i think that they you know i will give them a choice'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if i would like to add one more thing like in our generation we were really limited to few sports as a curriculum in school but nowadays that sports are really strong and biggest part of the children's growth the schools are adding because of the globalization the schools are adding more and more sports and activities in their curriculum i think that makes today's generation really strong really active so because i remember my childhood days we were not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh got those opportunities which right now this generation is getting so i think now i think it's really a good idea of schools you know adopting different kind of sports whether it is american football it is playing you know children are like exposed to different sports or different opportunities so i think that's really a good idea to include those sports in their curriculum so so that everyone has the exposure of those sports'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but at if i talk about myself i remember my school days we were very limited to few games only so i think the globalization really helped us to get more you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to getting the more opportunity in terms of sports and the parents are more aware how to make their child moles stronger how important physical activities are for the children i think if i talk about my parents they were as if i do compare of my parents and me so i think in today's generation the parents are more aware that they know how to make their children stronger because of the media because of the if you talk about different communication sources we get'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the opportunity to just get those exposure we get knowledge from different'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh communications overseas for an example we have some youtube videos we know and we search on google how to make our children's stronger i think that really helps us to learn more and more i think so if we talk about today's parents yeah they are more aware they know how to do good for their children and we motivate our children stop playing with the video games just go and play some activities outside that is really important for you i think so yeah i think that's really some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well we qualities we have to tell our children that how important the place for them not just playing video game every time and sitting on a couch or on a bed and just lying down we have to tell them go play and yeah so of course if they get stronger it will be really great for their long term fee future i think because everyone knows that how important activities are for the children and the diseases they will get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe later after few days so so somewhere i think uh it really helps actually for their stronger built so that will help in their future as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'going more sports the you know video games that are practices sports that have large international competitions who are winning a lot of money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i try to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so honest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so honestly i restrict my children they have a particular time to play video game they can't play just pick up their tab or xbox or they can't play every time they have a particular timetable for that like for an example in UK we have grammar schools so my children are preparing one of the child 's preparing for grammar school so so they have particular timetable like for playing for playing video games for studying so they have to have a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but what about competitiveness and team spirit and how is your gonna like like fortnite or i don't know counter-strike would be perfect for that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think you know what i think yeah but i think i think with with those type of with those type of games i think there's also the element of violence so you know also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but he's into the part of every sport'",
        "'speaker_4': 'probably but also you need to teach your you know you need to teach children about rivalry and about you know you can be competitive but you you know you should be doing things in the fairness of sport and you know there's things like fair play and you know being able to accept the fee so you're building certain characteristics as well same you can do it in sport you could do it in video games you really need to i think it's quite important that you build those characteristics and you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you teach children that's not everything is about winning and you know sometimes we focus so much on the winning but yeah it's nice to have that competitive you know that competitive edge and that competitive spirit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm so again it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so how do you balance that the you know the competitive spirit and the idea that not everyone should win'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well it's very you know it's very difficult but you have to explain that there's always you know winners and losers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know and that's just something that you know i've had to do it i'm sure everybody has to do it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just don't be a loser is that the idea'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no because that's no i'm not sure i'm not sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think reframing it is more about like dealing with hardship and like not that you're a loser but loss and to go back to the video game esport part of it i think that there are now i mean there are now like teams that you can compete on and while i think that people look down on video games as like a sedentary activity and it's like rotting brains and encouraging violence like that still is a huge market'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in fact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is becoming more popular and i think is providing that team and community aspect to children who may not have typically wanted to perform like to do sports and i think also going back to the children to being able to choose i think it's about like when they're developing and i don't have children but when they're developing exposing them to lots of different sports and kind of not just saying like if you don't play this then you know that's it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know you have to only play one sport i think being able to have the flexibility to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'expose them to different sports and you know encouraging them to keep at it but also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being able to realize you know like that it's OK to to quit if you're really not enjoying it but then also trying to redirect that energy into finding something else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah definitely definitely agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if i talk about my children they really enjoy minecraft and they they one day we were discussing about it and they were told they told me that they got some knowledge from minecraft so my children really love to play minecraft i will not say that every game is bad for them so it depends on the game to game actually i understand that sometimes it makes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the children aggressive maybe few games are bad for them but at the same time they develop their reflexes also so i think completely hindering them to just saying no to the game i think it's not a good idea because in today's age i think everyone every child is so fond of if games if we do that so that makes our child against our feelings or our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that what we say to them they will not then listen to us because they discuss these things with their friends in the school and they discuss what games they there's friends play at home so if we talk about if we told them do not play anything just go and play outside i don't think so they really like it i think balance has to be there parent has to keep an eye on them which game they are playing and we have to just make sure that there has to be a particular time so they can enjoy their space also and along with that they place'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'codes as well so i think for me both are really equal if we keep an eye on which kind of games they are playing so yeah i think games are also a really important part to develop their reflexes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know you know saying saying that balance is good but funnily enough in society these days how many children do you see go out and play sport like they used to when i was a child we would be out on the football field playing you know playing playing every single sport when it came round to super bowl time we'd be paying them even though in the UK we've been playing american football when it came round to wimbledon we be playing tennis and so you know but these days how many children do you know if i looked out and there's a field outside'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you wouldn't see children out playing like that these days most of the children either play sports at school or they or they you know they join the club they don't go out and play with friends like we used to or like society did twenty years ago so i mean and not all games you know again sitting on a computer game playing computer games'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know that's not all games are bad it helps it does help you develop as well there's a lot of educational games'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then also like i think halley's you know kind of alluded to as well esports is absolutely you know is absolutely huge right now you know and there's a team aspect there's you know there's people who make a lot of money paying these sports as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know when you talk about sport you talk about competitiveness it doesn't you know i mean it are we talking physical sport competitive sport there's all different you know variations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you know i mean you do have to have that balance and then also you know i guess it comes down to parents and their values and you know what they want to install in their children as well and they can't be left till you know to to the teachers to kind of install that i think it starts it starts at home'",
        "'speaker_3': 'obviously yeah for sure i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i saw him'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well i i mean we talked a lot about the balance but actually isn't that the whole point of this discussion is like where is this balance is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that you know the yeah i mean everybody would agree that we they need to have some physical activity you need to have some competitiveness some you know team playing some maybe education and everything how do we balance that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course we have to tell them like they have a particular time for them as i as i uh just discuss that i had a i have made a proper timetable for my children once they come back from the school and they have a particular time for their TV time games time and then studying and for their play time outside in the garden and sometimes they also help me in house chores so yeah we have to make a proper timetable if you leave the children along with game they will not realize how much they are playing they will just keep on playing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so as a parent it is our role basically to tell them what sometimes they don't follow rules they don't follow timetables just they just forget and just playing and playing on so i have to remind them now you have to make those changes and sometimes we make a reminder on alexa or google also to remind them they have to now switch off the TV i have a an app in my mobile that's smart plug app and then i can switch off the TV through my mobile app if i'm somewhere out and they are still playing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh they are still watching TV so i think we have to tell them again and again we have to reinforce those things in them that yeah you have to maintain a balance in your life we understand that yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and i think it's down again it's gonna be down to it's gonna be down to the parents because you're not gonna be able to rely on you know and also i mean i guess to a certain sense teachers scholars mentors whoever it may be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know but ultimately if we're talking about children it's gonna be down to you know the parents to install these things and to find that you know find find that balance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think coming out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and unfortunately you know i'm only in control of what i do with my children for instance'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know if it's not for me to say what you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'anybody else should really do with their children'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well goes you know a bit before we were discussing that you know children need to have choice and you know that they need to decide for them ohh how does it fit with the you know the the time schedule that the duty provides about you know you can have that many hours of TV 's at that moment and then that may and then you study and then you you know play outside for two hours and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think i think that's good i think that's good i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no that's a good i think that's a good idea i mean you gotta have some kind of structure it's the same thing that you know it's the same thing if you know in the workplace you gotta have some type as an adult you'd have to have some kind of structure and some kind of you know so it's always good to be able to you know to plan your day and divide your day up so you're getting a fair share of everything fair share of learning fair share of sport fair share of you know of of everything i mean but again'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is the structure that we do not create'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean your children'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they they they they have to follow it because you know the the parent told them to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how how they going to learn about this creating their own structure then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i mean you you install it into them i mean it's something you you know it's something you installed into your you know into your children the same way that it was installed into me as a you know as a as a child you know my mum used to put a like a timetable and you know give me choice as well say OK you gotta split out this timetable what do you want to do and if she thought it was reasonable she said but she'd say OK do you think this is a good idea that you'll be playing football all day or you're going to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'outside all day you know you need to take some time to read a book you need to take some you know so it's something that she was very organized so it's something that seems you know installed into me and again it ultimately it's down to a parent to install these things into children because children do their learning between the age of say three and nine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and so if you can build that into them then then it bodes well for the future'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think also part of it too is balancing that aspect of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'kind of like not setting them up for failure but having that like that timetable or helping them kind of see like if you do this all day then you're going to like helping them see trade offs when they like don't use their time wisely or just like but obviously like not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh you know doing anything where it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like dangerous or like really going to like you know mess them up but kind of showing them how to like manage their time which is really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'college'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as as as exactly you need to you if you give them examples if you give them examples of you know college university the workplace and you give them good examples or good examples where sport will be helpful in the future or you know then yeah again you're setting them up to succeed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you thought you know and it's just told you that when you don't do that children tend to suffer'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i'm not saying it's easy but you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that's also going back to like playing sports like in high school if you have practice after school you have to manage homework and like that's i think another reason why because it's more of an organic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'realization'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and if they're doing it from early and if you're doing it from early then it but can't by that time it becomes you know it becomes the norm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think yeah i think definitely you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'helping them develop those organizational or planning skills or whatever it may be whatever you whatever you want to call it will you know yeah we'll set them up to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah to succeed in in being able to cope with you know the demands of planning and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so as we discussed about how important sports are for other children i would like to add in few pound pound points in that that as we all know you case whether sometimes it's really windy in the garden and it's raining so that's sometimes restrict our children to play outside to we should have some you know kind of board games for them or maybe some reading time you know we just swap these things with the outside play and add those things in their schedule'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that really helped them actually because the outer environment or the garden is not available to them every time because you know that october and november till march it's really windy sometimes very rainy outside for longer days you can't go outside so i think we should have some substitute for that also which really important for them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they said'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know what that's when i you know what that's what i enjoyed it the most that's why i enjoy sports and most'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the windy and rainy time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah i really loved that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i actually agree like you know sometimes it's a lot of fun you know if it's super snowy very cold outside you know to go somewhere in the woods and do something at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i don't feel comfortable with that weather because my oldest child has that some kind of that breathing problem that if he feels if he really in a windy weather he has that gets wheeze in his chest and some cough so that's really restrict us to go outside outside when it's really windy he can't go outside so you know as a parent i have to think about and yeah so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about things like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not every time it is it is possible as a parent we have to take care of that the weather is good for him or not so yeah we have to make sure that also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah absolutely and you have to you know and again it's like going back to finding a a sport that works for them like obviously if your child is is asthmatic or you know it maybe you know soccer isn't the best for them you know maybe something that's not as like running around the whole you know the time and but that's you know again part of the parent to to help steer them towards a sport that might you know work out better for them you know or finding something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is like an equivalent of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but there is also a question here that how physical it should be well in a way for example if your child decided really loves i don't know chess'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they prefer to sit inside and play chess a lot maybe which is possible'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is chest red is it is chest really a sport i mean these are on i'm not yeah i'm not yeah exactly i mean i personally you know i personally don't think it's a sport but people would think it is'",
