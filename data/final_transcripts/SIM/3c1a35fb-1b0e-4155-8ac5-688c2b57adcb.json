        "'speaker_1': 'OK hello everybody again'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you for being with me here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so let's start off with the audio check'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sandy would you start by saying the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'good morning the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'perfect and now uh emerald please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm good morning quick brown fox jumps over there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lazy dog yeah perfect thank you OK raja please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah good morning uh quick brown dog jumped over the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'morning'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lazy dog yes perfect OK sounds good sounds good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'today's uh topic is gonna be do you agree artificial intelligence is helping and improving humanity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i say for the sake of argument'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sandy and i are gonna take the con side and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the truth you were gonna take the pro side is everyone fine with that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes agreed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i'm looking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK perfect then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then i'll just i'll just start off with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'being on the con side i think that with in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'increasingly increasingly more people on this earth there will be more jobs required and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'AI is gonna take away from that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm since the jobs that are gonna be opening up more are probably gonna be like jobs of monitoring AI and such so i think it's not gonna be helpful and what you guys say to that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well to be honest i have to agree and disagree i have to i have to agree because yes you're right less people than need jobs than AI is going to take jobs but on the other hand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'AI system is going to create a world that you need to work less and spend more time on yourself because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well let's say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one hundred workers doing a job in ext time but AI and machines and you know the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the collection of this artificial intelligence system in the world can do this job in less than an hour maybe so you can get your payment still and you can spend this time on yourself like you don't have to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'discredit all of your time during the work so it has other beneficials so it doesn't mean that when you when you have to work less or that are less works available for people it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to you know affect your life in a bad way i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK umm uh sandy do you uh do you have anything yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's a it's kind of difficult because we are on the con side and actually i have arguments for the process but nevertheless what you said is of course an important factor but this of course just one factor and as emera explained it can improve things a lot during the working process but what i see as another con is on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in my concerns is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i see all the war machinery you know if you can yeah if you can send AI into wars that could make a lot of trouble i think that's one of my huge concerns with AI'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so i really i have to think about a little bit about this but yeah and yeah i have i have stomachs about this issue actually i know it's our future and we cannot deny and we cannot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah sure sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we cannot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh close and close this up for us but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm but but we have really think to an end about this issue if this is possible i think in there are jobs which shouldn't be allowed for AI for example in hospitals i don't really think that this is a good thing because you need empathy in for a work in hospitals and i already now see AI machines in hospitals here in germany'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and even though they just collect the the clothes for the washing machines it's just the start and i really have concerns about this yeah there are jobs which shouldn't be allowed for AI'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'elm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm a richard and do you have anything to say against that or or or add a pro site to the question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah i understand what exactly the question is ohc as of now we are discussing about the calls of a correct and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have you had a lot of advantages over the i uh with the help of AI it increases the efficiency it increases the decision power as compared to humans and yeah in workplaces yeah we can improve the efficiency with the help of AI technology it may it might be improving in the decision making capability as well but on the other side we have the cons as well because with the help of for AI'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh might be humans will become a lazy uh the unemployment rate will be rate will be increased and then one more thing is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with the help of EI'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah those are the cons which are basically observed and but of course as of now this era is moved toward into the technical things and AI is kind of a thing where all the processes or the products will kind will become automated so those kind of a constant process of a and so that i observed till now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK alright uh i think for the for the sake of argument uh you can you can just elaborate on the on the pro side so if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so is there anything on the pro side that you would like to emphasize here rajat'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh in the process uh yeah which i mentioned it increases the efficiency in the workplace so as of now see i'm from the IT background in information technology and we have the processes where it requires a manpower because those kind of a decisions or those kind of approaches are not able to tell now automated in our industry but with the help of AI artificial intelligence we don't require that kind of a manpower those decisions those processes will by default will work with the help of a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that kind of advantages we have uh with the help of air as of now and in in the industry mostly in the technical industry so that that kind of a close from my side'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if you want to i wanted to did you want to add something to that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i mean before going to the additional pros maybe i can just quickly return to send these arguments and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know bring my information bring my ideas on it like as she mentioned yes i can be used as a war machine but it depends isn't it i mean even today we have i mean lots of countries that have nuclear armageddon in their in their backyard and the question is are they going to use it or not so yes you can have a war machine that that is run by artificial intelligence and then that is quicker than a normal human being'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'premium being faster and more deadlier than the general but depends if you're going to use it or not on the other hand let's say i mean the words are not ending we have words all the time but if you have a machine that is run by artificial intelligence that could save people during the war there would be there would be much more good isn't it also in the using them in the hospitals in hospitals we need precision i don't have the numbers but i'm still in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's kind of a health industry that we know that the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'keep holes are less precise than'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and people are losing their lives so that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean uh artificial intelligence i don't think that they should be they should be disregarded in different fields we need them in law because also in no you you have you counter lots of human mistakes we need them in medicals and i i was going to bring the art issue like i yeah i mean not critical and directed the other topics but i don't know have you seen the recent developments in the artificial intelligence that creates art'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohhh alright OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know what you think about it but it just collects just collects the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cumulative knowledge of human beings and just transforms it into peace just piece of art in two seconds but you think about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's a huge problem'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a OK i was actually gonna gonna mention that as well so so please keep that in mind but to your first point regarding military and hospital work sandy do you have anything to counter to that or to add to that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'actually i have my thoughts yes it is and as as emery said it depends on if they are used or not and we really know that they would be used and i don't think that this is a question actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just imagine i'm it's not just about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i'm i'm i'm to use them as weapons i really mean to just imagine that they will be used as soldiers because they can they can move i i always have this movie i robot in my mind so it's very old movie i know but nevertheless i was shocked how and i really think this is possible that they develop maybe themselves and i don't know if this is all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'manageable is this really under control i don't i'm not sure about this because this is just a concern i don't know i know it's the future and so on and so forth but i'm really concerned about how to control this and you see what happens with these cars which can drive without a driver you know and if there is an accident'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no one can do something about this and this is just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just a few examples it doesn't happen so often but that the reason for this is why these cars are not used so often but if you imagine this in a war machinery where there are a lot of machines used and what what what can happen there because as emery said'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah if you if you heard the machine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it doesn't cause aches as if you heard human being and they they were just go forward you know what i mean i'm i cannot i cannot say this in the perfect english what i what i want to say but i really think this is a major issue and in the social jobs again'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah as i mentioned in social work i don't think that they can be really useful you cannot open the gate too much for example in schools also you don't need them in schools in my opinion you have to manage this by by people and yeah there should be red zones or red lines which you cannot cross'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if this will happen i don't know i don't i just don't know because it's all about efficiency and and so on and so forth and economics we all know this but i really hope that someone has this under control if this is used and this is but just one of my major concerns you know that scientists want to go further and further and further which is good because things will evolve and develop but of course there are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a lot of risk risks about such a such a thing and especially a i i don't know i don't know if it can be too much one day i really yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just have my concerns about this really maybe they are smarter someday as we are as emery said they can they can build things and they can calculate things in seconds which we will never be able to and yeah just think this to an end what can they actually what can they actually be able of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you're developed them further and further i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you sandy yes i'm i'm i mean i i do agree i also say the the risks involved that are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hard to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh calculate at this point in time and at this stage of development and so before we go on with the AI art part rajat do you have anything to counter to send these points on the pro side'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're definitely uh see as in terms of technological domain of AI is a kind of a that technology means AI that kind of a classifications like if i'm going to talk about the machine learning those are the concepts of in technology related to the air machine learning the big data so with the help of those machine learning big data algorithms we can easily face what kind of i mean on the basis of a raw data or the previous data we have we can easily put the algorithms there and we can easily predict the future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sort of working with states rights of the results we will get on the basis of the previous data so that kind of advantages we have with the help of AI technology in terms of a technical domain and we have the various algorithms these are no because already started those algorithms in the machine learning and just like if i'm going to take a real time example if we want to predict the sales figure of any corporate so on the basis of the last year statistics which i have i can easily predict what exactly the profit or the losses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'might be i will face in the future so that kind of advantageous we have with the help of air technology in terms of technology technological domain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so since sandy was emphasizing the part that has to do with empathy and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and human lives what do you say to that rajat is that in your opinion also yeah calculable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah uh in terms of human life i agree with one point uh yeah a strange uh we had a a cons as well in terms of human life because see if we put the AI into the into the robot or just like the human things which are we generally do and if we put if we if we're going to put this particular things automated with the help of AI technology so might be the decision makings because sometimes we need to use our emotions to take a decision OK but with the help of AI that particular thing will be skipped'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and on the basis of that sometimes it's not sometimes yeah might be it will be a difficult or harmful in the future if we give that kind of access to that particular technology because human emotions is also require sometimes to take a decisions not into the personal level into the professional level as well or in terms of a defense if we put the our weapons automated and we can but at the end we need to give the particular response from our end then only it will operate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK but with the help of air my with because of the they don't have the emotions or they don't have that kind of a logical thinking might be it will be harmful for the in the future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm OK thank you ron'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm alright then uh so U M'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh emeric could you please read elaborate on the AI art part and focusing on the pro side'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so we thank you when we think about the human human history and development of part we have you know hundreds of years developed hundreds of years pending finding the right idea and developing on this idea and people have faced severe you know problems like like think about learning sounds or form and then jumping to the modern art after the world war two for example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like you have all of this huge data huge developments and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can introduce this to the artificial intelligence and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in seconds it's going to create an art piece for you i mean why this is important of course of course it's not dire as like talking about topics with the AI features students but to some some part of the populations really important i can see that that there would be cons of this like copyright issues et cetera but everything everything can be solved because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i'm not an expert on this but we know how artificial intelligence is developed and is working and we know how art art'",
        "'speaker_3': 'works like i mean how jobs in the art industry are developed and how artists are working yeah when you put all of this together you can you can see that it's a huge pro for the human culture human developments like maybe you don't see the pro of it right now like let's say AI is creating another piece of picasso you can say that well it's worthless but for the future generation for the next generation it's going to be an inverse effect'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because a i will also add things on top of each other as humankind it and then at the end it's going to create more beautiful or more you know art pieces more variety but in the future researchers will investigate this like in the past it it has happened in one thousand years now it's happening in five years so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so so you're you're saying so it's gonna develop into more intricate artwork and at the same time it's gonna be viewed differently by future generations than us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yeah and sandy do you have anything against that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm the bed copier about this issue and if we talk about art when i think about art it's if i look back what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm people created while doing art is they they work with their emotions they work with their experiences what they saw what they yeah who they meet who they met and so on and so forth what kind of melodies they had in their mind where they have been and it's a process where they created something beautiful within'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah within their souls and they expressed it if you think of music music when you think of a mozart or beethoven day they heard something in their head and they created something just beautiful collected from pieces'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from their soul what they saw and who they talk to and this machine generated things the only the only positive thing when i hear this is they can build this within seconds and they can it's like a mathematic for them if you think if you think of music they they just they know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what is harmony and they just bring the notes together to build a beautiful harmony but it's it's so less in my in my opinion and completely so less beethoven worked for years for the perfect melody mozart two and they built this in seconds i don't know what's good about this actually it it cannot be filled with with passion it cannot be filled with it's just it's just calculated music'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in in my view maybe maybe it will sound beautiful yes but it has no soul in my opinion and i it's like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have you ever seen uh the pictures apes and monks are able to build to to paint and i think these are these are individuals and they have they have a soul and i think this is more this is more worthy than a picture what ape painted then a picture of such an A i think maybe you can use this for yeah in in medicine i don't know then it could be helpful i don't know for what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what four but it could be helpful but any other thing to to to make my life better to fill my life with beautiful things i actually don't i will not need this i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm OK so so you so you're rather focusing on the on the expression and the and and and the work part of the artist'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm when you're uh looking or or enjoying art'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course of course the artist tried to express something and it's also in literate in in in literature if one one write a book and so on day one to tell us something and the question is do we see this or how we see this and so on and so forth because they shared something with us but what will what will a robot share with me i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm OK thank you rajat in anything against that on the pro side'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in terms of art i agree with the sandy because the art is come from the military or the emotions you have and uh yes if it it it might be automated so i don't think that kind of a melody we will get with the help of a in in the in the domain of art so yeah i totally agree with the sandy the arts and such kind of things should be emotional fool i mean the the humanity whatever the personality you have what are the memories you have according to that that particular art will come and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in terms of artificial intelligence i don't think it will be automated because those things are only limited to that machineries or the the things which we need to put that kind of effort and we will get the result easily those things are limited to that particular thing only but yeah in terms of art and such things and those should be the counts from the humans personality humans what are the melodies what are the memories he have they are totally happy with that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe i'm sorry maybe i can add one point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if i listen to the pros also in art i get the feeling that we will live in a perfect world because what they create they i guess they are they are animated to create it perfect also if they create music or something like this and i really think a world'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which has too much influence by eye'",
        "'speaker_2': 'would be too perfect for me and it will be very very very boring sooner or later such a perfect world i i don't think that this can be good people make mistakes also in art and if you if you listen to some symphonies you find these mistakes and you wonder or you find especially the mistake beautiful and if everything is created perfect must be very boring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm OK thank you did you wanna add something to that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah yes please well i don't think i don't think that the the product that that are produced by a i mean in terms of are they are not excellent as i've stated before they are actually following slash copying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know what's the what's the english word for that impressions of different artists like everyone has a different team every time point i mean renaissance is really different than post modern art when you think about it but every AI is kind of specialized in one one era so if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and artificial intelligence is working and producing the the post modern art it's not going to be perfect it's quite contrary to it will be imperfect because it carries the essence of this time essence of this art and the other thing is that when you say i mean when i say these these things it shows me that AI has this separate sandy sandy mention because it knows the error it knows the art pieces before'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it just collects everything this knowledge and put it to the ACT only difference is that it just doing it faster than the artists so i do think that artists are doing the same they're just combining the cumulative information yes they have a filter you can call it an emotional filter but it's not different than the filter that AI has that's what i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it doesn't mean that it doesn't have a split it just depends how you define'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i remember uh rajat mentioning at the beginning of our conversation that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'AI is in some way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm let's say uh supporting people 's laziness did i get that right richard or or could you further elaborate on that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah that point yeah i'll see oh look we have the consent approves of air so with the help of air might be we don't have that kind of a productivity because everything will be automated so humans will become a lazy they don't because and that will be a cons for the AI because we should be a productive and with the help of this new challenges we will become a productive means we face the new challenges in life and that's why our productivity will increase this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but with the help of air both those things if those things will those things will be replaced by the US so that kind of productivity i don't think we don't have that kind of productivity or that kind of productivity with keep from us so yeah that is also in terms of AI so challenges should require in a life and that makes you a different kind of personality'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK since you're on the uh pro side uh do you do you have anything more to add to that in terms of productivity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'matt how how how that is gonna help rajat since you're yeah you you seem to be more knowledgeable about it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah in terms of productivity yeah correct with the help of a we will get the result in a very short time OK as compared to the human but yep product to deal increased the efficiency will increase in the work but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but after some days our gradually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah as the sandy told us no that thing will become boring because we are not able to face a new challenges and we are not able to update it with the new technologies or we are not able to get the new thing not get to learn a new things in a live because everything will be take care of the year and that will be a call because the thing is that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh ohh with the help of that we are not able to face anything being in the life which is challenging and that's why it will become a boring for us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but sandy you have a yeah yeah another con argument for regarding productivity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'productivity icon argument yeah as you mentioned at the start it just'",
