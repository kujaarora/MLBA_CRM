        "'speaker_1': 'be available for certain forms of employment get income and things of that nature whereas on the converse you can have an education and not participate in sports and still'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'good point'",

        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm as well as the the benefits like the the benefits that people will tell like team you know working together as a team team approach learning how to fail learning how to lose those skills and things can be taught in group settings and in school as well when you work on class projects you know it PE you there's physical education and in school that supplements the academic education so a lot of the different benefits of sports can still be gained in classroom environments and classroom settings or in internships and things of that nature'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but playing sport contributes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't think it's like a the same thing same effect with the sport because with in sports if you play as a team you're gonna win as a team and if you don't you're gonna lose as a team so it's a you have to play as a team and in the in group projects it's not like that usually i mean you can be individually rated as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you you have to work as a group and when you're you have to work as a team when you're in a group too and at school if a teacher assigns four or five students a particular assignment and they have one goal they have to produce this'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but sometimes they are they are ranked individually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i think everybody would have to you you have to do certain things like delegate you know who's gonna play this role who's gonna do this particular task and who's gonna do this thing but we're all working together to achieve a common outcome and you can that's the same thing you would do on a sports team'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but we have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you have to support each other you have to communicate all of those things are still the same in a classroom setting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep and that's the most ideal time situation but sometimes we are ignoring the people who can't do this part and who is not really motivated and normally the kid who did spotted during the the childhood that much more active and they are much more easy to share their idea you can see they are they are very popular during the group'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the but the point was made that you can still be active while you're getting an an education like i mentioned there's physical education and their sports in school extracurricular activities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm you know lots of students play soccer softball baseball basketball we're having in addition to their education at just as in an academic structure not on a sports team but as part of the school curriculum so i'm separating that out so you'd still be active'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and be physically fit and get the health benefits of moving around and participating in activity and physical activity without without participating on a sports team'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i i i also worry about if uh if sports were put on the same level as formal education and i think most kids have already have enough pressure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh on them with a formal education and if you do that if you do the same with sports as well wouldn't that take a lot of fun out of it make it probably too competitive maybe maybe the kids don't develop the the right approach to physical activity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stressful'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think no one should be forced this but if they have a interest in the certain kind of sports then they should go for it but otherwise you cannot force anyone and yeah it's like that you say it will kill the fun'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if but if you put it on the same level as formal education that means it's required just like most societies provide education and require each child to be provided a certain level of education so that they can be contribute to society so this debate is about whether or not it should be on the same level and if it is equal to formal education as my partner mentioned then there would be lots of pressure and then not to mention the fact that not every child is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i'm also like that but if i would go for it i think i could develop myself and become better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'overcome yourself you gain something by overcoming the problems you had therefore it's a process for the kids'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i agree that it's helpful in developing a in a child a certain resilience and the ability to persevere and and and to push to raise to a certain standard but there again speaks to the point where it should supplement education and not be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'equal to formal education because the benefits and the qualities of both can complement each other however if that child does not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'come to the to the race to the to the standard of peak performance or even adequate performance in a sport at least then they still have what they learn in school to fall back on in order to progress through life and and you know be able to make a living for themselves'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i wanna bring up another point that if we make education and sports equal and requirement'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what about injuries repetitive use injuries overuse injuries there have been cases where children who participate in competitive sports young children have died on the field because of cardiac problems that their parents didn't even know they had heat stroke and and things of that nature if we're gonna raise the requirement of sports in the same level of education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like was mentioned is going to push the children harder and potentially increase tragedies injuries and death rates'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but before getting in in the medical in the sports you can just get a a check up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you can't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for this kind of uh risks if you have or not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but you can count all way to avoid the risk and to to not do something this is not for i don't it's also not for a kid and if we cite the the sport as important as the the education and we will develop a better system we protect the kid and we train the coach their good therefore we put the kid into a happy healthy childhood and it's also much more better than the kid who do not have a sport'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'who do not join any team during their childhood and i believe this will also put the kids into a better situation when they are growing up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but how can we predict even a child can have a physical exam or a check up that could disqualify them from being able to participate in sports and so if we're saying that they have to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'active in sports as much as they have to go to school but their physical health because they are you have to remember being inclusive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would require where or requiring children with disabilities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to do the same so if a child has a physical examination and they do not have the health understanding to be able to participate in any sport then where does that leave them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK but if we are talking about small group and you think if we do not cite as a standard and therefore the the the the small group not will get hurt but actually the good way to include the small group is we do the sport and we invite them to do what they can do what they are able to do that maybe better than you just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what do you mean by the small group'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what do you mean by the small group a group of children who may have disabilities you're saying modify'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's small grown better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah they can't they can't they can't really join join the some specific sport'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but what if they can't tolerate sports at all i i am a physical therapist and i treat children with pediatric pediatric i have i've had pediatric patients who cannot participate in in in sports pretty much to any degree they may be able to there's a difference in that needs to be this needs to be identified there's a difference in'",

        "'speaker_2': 'mom'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know hitting balloons those are activities those are not sports not every child can participate at all in any sport and it puts them under a lot of pressure and parents under a lot of stress if you're saying their child has to meet a certain standard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'like for some kids at school is a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is tough enough right and so if if you add a sports to that i mean i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh it's it's very likely that the social structures or social dynamics that they have are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are going to be found in sports as well so so if they get bullied a lot in school they may get bullied a lot in sports as well and and that just enhances the the whole problem don't you think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah good point that yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's true i agree it it makes them more vulnerable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all all all they funded'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK all they find their own group all they found a lot of fun and during doing the sport with their sport mate that could be the opposite part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's true i agree that there are some children who are not academically inclined and who are more athletically inclined and so they're outlet they're reprieve their you know the their emotional booster for them around is the fact that they participate in sports which is why it should supplement and complement formal education but not be required on the same level'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i think everyone can have something because you just need to try a lot maybe but i think in the end you can find something that fits you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you guys said that it's hard enough in the school in terms of subjects for example i think if it is a mandatory thing the sports as well i think the curriculum will be modified as well so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if they are both mandatory so probably it's gonna be like modified so that it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that uh part and not time consuming'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what would that what would that look like though if if they if it's mandated as part of the curriculum there's only so much time in a day there are only so many days in a school year'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the umm we are talking about the time whether this kid will have enough time to do to do a balance between the sport and the the the education but think about if we make the education time a little bit less and therefore you you sacrifice the time to give to the sport this may sound a little bit crazy but'",
