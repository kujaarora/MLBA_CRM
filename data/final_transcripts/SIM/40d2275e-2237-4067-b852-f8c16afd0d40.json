        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in this instance i'm not sure if that person even would in first instance try and apply for the job so in directly we are anyway drawn to the people who are like us so if you create that atmosphere and culture you will most likely receive people applications from the certain background or the certain certain appearance let's say who will come and they will feel good and they will deliver great engagement satisfaction and and well also profits so'",
