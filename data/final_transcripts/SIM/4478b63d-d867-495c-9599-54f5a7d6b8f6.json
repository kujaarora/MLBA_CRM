        "'speaker_4': 'let's see the fifteen or sixteen and they're working on like a grocery store stocking shelves big roughly they don't need to get the same weight as someone just go like a family and kiss the fee and stuff like that so i think that depends on where they are in their lives in their careers and stuff like that it's not just a simple minimum wage you should should depend'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it would be really hard to implement and then you would also have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'obviously someone who has a family is more in need of money than someone who doesn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the little things such as like exceptions and like special circumstances so then you would have a hard time of when to like draw the line'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yet but in the in the in the UK we already have a system like that different age groups get different minimum wages i think it's eighteen i think eighteen years old is the way i'm not completely sure but i think eighteen years old is like the the dividing line between like min and which you can get different ages'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no actually there's more than one i think there's like fifteen eighteen and then eighteen plus some like some some to the you get different minimum wages depending on your age but something inside like i don't know if you do that in america but in the UK we have a system so into that depends on how old you are'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you need to find something that like you're getting you have to get paid something livable because you can't for example in california'",

        "'speaker_3': 'so you like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but is she is but even the different states i'm sure there's a different like if you live in a big city it's gonna cost way more than like i don't know the outskirts of to say like so in the UK and london is very expensive and most companies pay you extra just eleven might work in london so they could also they can always implement some like that so you can live in in new york or los angeles or something like that you can get paid more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's what i hope'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'so the topic of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'today is should minimum wage be increased does minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of the employees up to but you like to start please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so like i was saying i think it depends on a case by case scenario depends where you live how old you are if you have any dependents you know there's a lot of factors that depend on what someone 's minimum wage should be and i think we should take that into account and rather than just like i said about because that that's that amount was never gonna convert everyone you know it's not common for people to have more jobs just so they can write living live by like support the family and that's that's that shouldn't be the case'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that that like this scenario i'm talking about would be hard to implement'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it can lead to cases of exploitation where companies will only hire people that they have to pay less so there could be a lot of like legal jargon and then like a lot of laws to protect different people to make sure companies aren't hiring people so they can pay them less but they implement something like that then it would be i think that would be the one the best case scenarios for getting on the whole minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh debate but be one of the hottest hottest solutions as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean we're gonna if there are any sort of like safeguards companies are gonna find a way to find a loophole to pay you less whether it's to find someone younger like you were saying or find something like maybe find someone with like less experience and say they're paying them with experience cause i've had people were like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we won't pay you this will be like an internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they'll be there will basically be working but they won't get paid because it's you're getting paid with quote unquote experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's i think that should be banned realistically as unpaid labor that should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah the thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i like the idea that there could be some parameters in posed but from a legal perspective i think you'd have a lot of people trying to take it to court that you're discriminating me against me because i'm not married or because of my age or the type of work i've done'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe where i went to school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yet yeah but that but then what are the other alternatives for like just as flat rate because we know that that's not gonna work because even even if you look by a state by state basis like i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why'",
        "'speaker_4': 'texas well i don't i'm not from america i'm in the UK so i well let's i'll use the UK as example london is very expensive to live in like so much more expensive than anywhere else in the UK so if you want to live in london you couldn't live in london the minimum wage you'd have to like more like a set for most companies pay people extra just to live in london even then it doesn't always cover the additional cost of living such a big expensive state'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so just like a state by state case wouldn't really work in america you like even if like uh if you raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars and it's like new york like that that would be enough to live off of fifteen dollars an hour'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and by the same token in a state in the middle like kansas or where the cost of living is a lot lower'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i hate to say you don't deserve the fifteen dollars an hour but may not need you well you don't need what the person in new york needs so i think there are some factors that can factor into it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but if it isn't the place to live in can they couldn't you argue that's the type of discrimination as well like i was like you said age and like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'work experience could be used can that you can also use where you live'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it actually discrimination because you're you're basing it off not whether they live but the cost of living in that area'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so would it be like oh hey we hate you 'cause you're from kansas no it's because kansas has a lower cost of living compared to like new york or los angeles'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so is there like is there is there is there like a defined way that they could put the minimum wage i don't i'm not sure this is the do you guys know or do they just like yes i don't think there's i think they just kind of like set it but if they if they could come up with like i'm like a formula depends on like i don't know how much food cost how much rent cost you know how much they're like different parameters to calculate the minimum wage that would be more fair than what i think the current system has and that's just like kind of basing it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i have not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just kind of around around them in choosing the number'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even with a salaried position when uh even with a salaried position not minimum wage with a company the same position in new york'",
        "'speaker_3': 'pill'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has a higher salary than that position in say pittsburgh because the cost of living is so much lower than pittsburgh so there are there are formulary things that could go in there and i think do go in there too and extent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'm saying can we factor agent to that as well to that point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry after but i think maria fernanda wanted to jump in there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'talking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i do wanna talk about like we're saying cost of living but we also have to factor in inflation economic like standpoint so right now like economy is you know there's a lot of inflation there's the talking about like possible recession so it kind of has like i feel like it would be a set point a set number'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for certain point because it has to be flexible enough'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to basically like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'factoring like makes it like i said economic factors that isn't your economic factors but rather the countries because right now some people are paying literally eight dollars for a dozen eggs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and some people are paying three dollars'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it really it really depends'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and even when you get into'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you get into the issue that i've never thought was fair but an employer might give you a two percent increase on an annual basis while if the inflation rate is four percent i'm actually making less money each year'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i think there should be factors that definitely have to be considered'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when they determine these'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because back then you could literally it's like this whole debate and i guess like with people like ohh i used to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then i could pay off my house with that job or i could pay off pay off my schooling with that job but nowadays with that money you wouldn't be been able to pay for a semester'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in school in college because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah isn't it like like wages have stagnated isn't that the case and around the world like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'extremely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stagnated and then you have everything else being increasing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like there's fees upon fees upon fees that they're adding on and you have to pay it because it is what it is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i feel like that should be like equal amounts if you're gonna raise the price of this then you have to pay me more because if not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the issue with like say you could even play it with discrimination i pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for a XY and Z and people generation beforehand could with that amount of money therefore it's not an issue with me and me being lazy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's how much of being paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK but i think the only way to the only way to really fix sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please go ahead up though'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think the only way to really fix the problem is to get lawmakers involved and part takes because we can't really expect these companies to start paying people more have the kindness of their hearts because that doesn't make any sense their business and then the day they're trying to make as much money as possible so i think we're like we have to get we have to force these companies being able to pay people more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's only waited'",
        "'speaker_3': 'many of these'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't come to the US abdul'",
        "'speaker_3': 'many of them are paying to go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with cap they don't want government involved'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the point that they're not gonna do anything the these companies are paying people off they're paying off'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'he's lawmakers have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like the or the ones at the NRA in their hands they have like so many companies'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in their pockets that they're not gonna think about the well being of the human of the people of like the american people they're gonna think about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then many people think that if we raise the wages that's not affect the rich and the rich is what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is in a help us get paid cause it's trickled down economics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i'm not gonna say whether it works or not but we have a lot more poor people now the the depression in the middle and high or the the the lower class in the rich is getting wider and i haven't seen it working but a lot of the people here think OK we can't affect the rich we can't make them pay us more because it's in a affects the economy it's gonna like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're gonna they they basically think that by winning that extra one two dollars is gonna make them lose in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know how it's gonna work but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'many of them were cautious'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that's an interesting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i think it's an interesting point what maria fernanda said so basically you're saying if the minimum were i mean if the minimum wage is increased there there would be some benefits to it but in the long run it would hurt the economy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so what what would be actually those factors that that would be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the long run'",
        "'speaker_1': 'problematic or what what hurt the people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they would also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or you think that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they would outsource our U M'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the employers they would just find someone you know would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to other countries'",
        "'speaker_3': 'child labor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have that like with any sort of clothing company nowadays where you're going to have like she and you're gonna have kids or pregnant women or people that are like obviously with issues basically making her clothes and they're paying them they're cheap i would say not even close to livable wage and that's what they're doing they don't want to pay more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to update your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no sort of lawmaker will be advocating for this because they know that it's gonna cost us more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's what that's reality of things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but couldn't you kind of like get together cause everyone's suffering and get like like everyone kind of knows what's going on that they're not getting paid as much as they should be so can we stop voting for like cause from outside perspective from the UK kind of looks like in america you we only have two choices democrats and republican and i think that's kind of like tendering change because in the UK we have more than two main political parties we have two main but we have other ones that you can go for that actually can make a difference but by'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but that's i'm saying i think yeah but that's i'm saying you you kind of logged into either or either the democrats or republican and i i feel like that's kind of pandering development in the country like because they they both know like you got you have to choose either or you can't we choose the third option'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i'",

        "'speaker_3': 'and there was a lot of issues there were being fired they were being exploited they were like their hours were like really off like they were working a lot but it was an issue i don't know a lot about it but i know that there was an issue with them trained to form a union'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think that could be one of the ways we start making the change with unions and forcing companies to actually start paying people livable wage because i i agree what we say like gain lawmakers to change in mind it's very unlikely cause the gain paid off but if you can off from unions even though they were gonna they gonna try and stop you you can like there's no i don't think there's any legal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all the to the legal harder to like stop you from the union like i'm i'm pretty sure it's harder to do in america than in the UK but i'm they know they're definitely ways around'",

        "'speaker_3': 'like there's a lot of like OK we wanna help you but and there's always like a a little like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's something that you do or like it's always there's always an issue cause like my dad 's in a union and i think he has to pay to be in the union and it's i don't see any positive change there hasn't been some sort of increase'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the street'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe restructuring how sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm blue'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh during if you want to jump in please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm going to change the subject a little bit so if you guys want to keep on this one go ahead and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'debate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no please go ahead three'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i was just curious curious abdul with the age thing how that works because here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i almost feel like versus age it should be job responsibilities related or something because if i'm sixteen and i'm working at mcdonald's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if i come in and i'm forty five and i'm just this is still my first job even at forty five i don't think just because i'm older i should be making more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if we're doing the exact same job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'thinking more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'abilities in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so and it sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maria go ahead please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh so i'm and i'm guessing you're referring to like experience level is that what you're saying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah maybe and and i don't know i don't know if it works well or not but i think in the government they have like levels and so there are certain types of responsibilities that fall under level one under level two so then you look at the job responsibilities and say OK this is a level one job so for that one minimum wage is only going to be ten dollars an hour but if you jump up to level two because it's more responsibilities than the minimum wage there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'should be fifteen dollars an hour'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i would find it a little easier if it was if you were justifying a cost difference on things like that and the cost of living in your area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so how it works in the UK i think there's different levels but in the different levels there there's a range'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so there's a minimum the maximum you can pay someone dependent on i think age is the biggest factor in how they worked other company so like you were saying if someones wife having their still working as in like mcdonald's give it probably about that time they probably have to be at the maximum rate the maximum pay at the job level if you understand what i mean they wouldn't be at the minimum because the been working there for so long or because they're just so much older than anyone like fifteen or sixteen something like that so that's just that's how it works in the UK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so each job level has different ranges and age and experience and all these other kinds of factor that goes into how much you get paid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and how would you factor in like i would say because your job is where you would have a set amount of a bit of responsibilities but like any other job you would have your boss telling you to do other things like i had one job where i had one set of responsibilities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it ended up i had ended up working on four different jobs when i left they had to i hired two more people to do what i was doing because i was doing the job of several people so how do you find that in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and that's where i think the second part of the question about do companies use that to take advantage and i definitely think that's an example of ways that they would take advantage of it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's why i seen about the unions or at least some type of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'entity to help that you can go to and complain and demand higher wage or demand their work hours i think that's the that's the thing you can do to start improving wages or at least work like work environment you need someone to go to that you can that can bark you that can give you give you legal advice and stuff like that because if you don't these companies always gonna like you know pressure to mark our words or do more jobs take like pay you know stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean one of the problems and let's say we have a minimum wage increase a significant minimum wage increase one of the problems of company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe exposing priest is seeing that because of the minimum wage increase'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and qualified personnel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and would actually work at entry level jobs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and like this you could you have the problem that people without any work experience and have a problem finding a job and you actually get qualified personnel for a lower price'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would you agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i can see how they're they're exploit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so they would hire people they experience as entry level employees right is that what you're saying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i know they they don't seem to make across the board with businesses adjustments for stuff like that because when i started a job at one company i think the pay was like thirty thousand dollars well within five years'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the starting salary was thirty five or forty thousand dollars for the new person coming in so all of a sudden i've been there for two years with experience and the new guy that just comes in is making more than i do it it feels like when they have adjustments like that they should have to come back and across the board adjust because otherwise you just have the same type of discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i definitely do agree because you need transparency because if you don't talk with the other person or you don't see the posting online you wouldn't know that they're getting paid more than you are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah companies almost threatened you you're not allowed to talk about your salary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they think that they keep us in the dark like that but that's just not true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to what could be a solution without like would you i don't know post online do enormously cause in some companies in the UK it's like a you can find information online because when i done my internship the information was on you can just find it on the company website so you got different levels and then in the different levels you saw different ranges and then for the people like the CEO or the CEO CEO and my people the the board you go to what level they were at so you kind of knew where they how much they were getting paid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think that's kind of like the workaround we have in some companies in the UK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean there there's like sorry during go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no you go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well there are websites like glassdoor where you can see the salary of pretty much every company there is right so i think there are there is more transparency coming in that regard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah definitely and i think that's a big plus'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's where you have to fight for yourself as an individual and i think if you have the union concept that would be more fair in those types of situations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i do agree that those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no please maria go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i was gonna say that the unions do help but you need sometimes it's gonna force because unions can only help so much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the need like i said the laws in place or some sort of system'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not only within the union because there's people that within the union that don't don't always want your uh your betterment they wanna support the board and they wanna support you so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so in the unions how do you get into one like how do you make your way up do you get boarding or do you like apply or i don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'does anyone know how it worked'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they solicit you because they want you to be in the union because the more employees that are in the union more power the union 's gonna have but you do pay like an annual fee i think for it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so basically you're paying somebody to negotiate for you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe she stopped can put more pressures on the indian to do a better job or to like every year that units have today i don't give a report on what they've done and what they've tried to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so they're not just sitting around taking people 's money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'one i think there's a significant portion of people in the US that are very much anti unions so there would have to be some education and changing of mindsets if you even want it to go down that path'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i do do do with that and i think that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i want to go away from the union and back to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maria please finish what you were about to say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry i just like went off my mind i was about to say something and i forgot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK no problem now i want to go a bit away from you know and back to what you said earlier about economical consequences of increasing the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean i think the the primary argument'",
        "'speaker_1': 'four increasing the minimum wage is that uh higher earnings would improve the overall standard of living of people right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if we go to the economy or economical consequences of increasing the minimum rage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and one of the problems probably is that or one of the arguments for it is that the cost of the companies would increase because the cost of labor increases'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and by that inflation increases because companies have to raise the prices of their products right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and that's also where small businesses'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so then the question becomes if inflation would increase yesterday please if you want to interject'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i was just gonna say that's where you get into a small business that maybe the only way they're able to stay in operation is by paying that minimum wage if you start raising it so high you'll drive them out of business i think that's the argument people leave or use that and we're going to be all big companies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but my'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my argument for that is even even like it might sound cruel but if a company could only be profitable because it's paying its employees of of minimum wage then the the cup that business probably shouldn't be in business if you know i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they they just they just go bad business model but when it comes to big multi multi billion dollar corporations they can deftly afford to pay minimum wage and guessing like walmart and target and companies make billions they can they can definitely forces like think crease the minimum wage to just choose not to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you're talking about local'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry go on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because i was saying like if you do want small businesses to thrive that you'd have like a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i wouldn't say like not scholarships are better like funding you would have like OK so incentivize these companies to know not go out of business and not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'obviously pay their people minimum wage then i guess you would intensify with like some sort of funding or some sort of like help'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that would in the long one motivate them to you know pay those people a livable wage and you could use that like that business as a model to show that if they could do it other companies can go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you talking about tax breaks for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'companies increase business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tax breaks or you could just have like i wouldn't say that's like funding like it not funding but like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe you could have some sort of like funny a little bit more money or like you said tax breaks because they're doing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh they're basically four runners for what they want other business to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but but it is i'm going to do that unless they make a profit and talk in the long run so if they don't if they lose my they're not going to do it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean no but the issue is having first up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and i wondered'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you're gonna go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the thought just flew out of my head too so go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no problem during and but going back to what maria fernanda said they just small businesses were would be affected and then big corporations could probably pay the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and wouldn't maybe another problem be that maybe big corporations might also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thing and the result of that would actually be that they need to cut jobs so you would get an increase in pay but corporations would need to lay off people in order to pay that increase in minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they would definitely do that and i like i was saying before they would definitely do that and then they would replace those jobs if they were to replace'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those people because some people would end up having to do multiple things or multiple responsibilities just keep their position afloat is to outsource so you'd have to be you'd outsource people that don't know you know what is minimum wage or they're desperate for any sort of money and you're paying them like secretly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'including like uh immigrants or like you know people who don't even live in the US'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not a livable wage and you're getting that position you're basically have that position filled with someone that that money and they they'll get they'll they'll settle for anything'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you can't your pillows around that just don't companies outsourcing work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you definitely can but the the same will have laws not allowing people to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you pay immigrants who don't have it like you know aren't legal and it still happened so it's still gonna cordless'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'while not philosophy is usually politically driven too so if you get a democratic president in for four years they'll say we're not going to take the jobs out of the country then a rap earth a republican comes in and says oh no we wanna help businesses lower their costs so you can take it out so it all gets them down to the whole political end of things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so can the solution'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you got'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can the solution be creating another body'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that focuses that just focuses just in wages and stuff like that that's different from white cargo so it's not the president the president 's or doesn't decide the minimum wage or has influenced like a another body like how do you you have like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh you have i don't know what they call in america that you have what they call it again there like you have different'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not ministers there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what i'm looking for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah we have we have to i don't know just call it departments like that that's specialize in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah different departments'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah can you have the department that focuses'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah we have that and then it's mostly just like dependent on the state to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think right it is depending on the state to like set the prices for like minimum wage and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as i think that's a big problem if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to advance of anything if you if it comes from a federal level i think it's easier as if you have like if you send american fifty two or fifty one states deciding for themselves right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah pretty much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's basically a people where you can't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is some sort of a difference there's there's been trying to like increase the minimum wage but like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not gonna be increased so in the places that have like you were supposed to be for the wait but places have acceptable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they might not need a lot they definitely do need to increase it because seven dollars is not livable by any means'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm OK'",
