        "'speaker_2': 'yeah out there there are safety issues that go that go on that with you know with with their lines but i think that you know somebody can be like not really physically attractive but being great shape and be slim you know but they might not necessarily get hired because they're not physically attractive'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah yeah of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i i i think well if it comes to physical attractive it's just really comes down if you're representing the brand or not like you said at the start so let's say let's say if you have like for example a gucci store understand that they won't won't attractive attractive salesman and saleswoman in there because you're representing the brand and you're representing a really specific kind of clear intel and that clientel sees that or you you're presenting the brand so you you need in this positions you need this kind of people'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i feel like being lured into a workspace based solely on appearance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm and the terms of being an attractive it's like who who if if someone were like yeah you look the part the first question is who told you that like who he's attracted to me who am i attractive to is it just you or are you gonna be trying to do something are you gonna be trying to match me with someone like what is that attractive thing that's why i don't agree with that part because it's like you could have that person could have been married for seventeen years but just because you think they're drop dead gorgeous and you hire them that could cause problems in their life'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you look for the side that there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think what we're getting what we're getting away from is i'm gonna say like if you're down on rodeo drive and you are dressed bummy and stuff like that and you go in for a job and those stores right there you're not gonna get hired on because they do judge you and they want that clientele that they want to they want to hire people that are going to match that clientele is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'd hire them but i would start them in the back stock room so they saw what was available here and i say you know what drew you here do you like the things here you can start the stockroom and once you start getting your paychecks you can start'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh obtaining and and and getting some of these things that you see or things alike'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people who work on rodeo drive can't afford the things on rodeo i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but i think i think that's not i don't i i don't think it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well at all it all comes into a employee and employer relationships i can tell you i make things by hand and you know those things cost a little bit more most of the time but if i had someone that knew about what i was doing they knew my products from the back of their hand they could tell me why why i made this object for another person they could tell me what i was probably making next and if they did that part like some people do that like they're like i know you're probably thinking about making this for that person because this happened'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's a different all different thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'd like i need you i know you don't look the part but i need you i need you and i also need you to tell me what you need and i might be the person that gives them a two hundred and fifty dollar handmade dress for fifteen dollars because where'd my assistant go if i sent them out the room that person knew everything about me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's that's going to be very rare'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes but in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's gonna be very rare because the simple fact is is these clothing designers especially like specifically the clothing designers they don't want'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and when you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'unattractive people wearing their clothes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and i think it i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because their brand has an image to maintain'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think it's it's OK it's OK to recruit the people that depending on their appearance but i think it goes too far if you tell them like for example put a button up open on your shirt or something like that that's like sexually discriminating i think there it goes too far so the question is like kind of like where you draw the line right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and like you said'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what do you think of like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what do you think of then of like restaurants like hooters that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hooters won't hire me and it's awful'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i think that's that's'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i've seen good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i grew up in the area these people all know me and they all they're just drunks and watch sports so i don't even see why they feel so high and mighty and the person that owns it it's like OK so you might not be a drunk but you're the person that sits there in your chair and watches that so it's like you're not any better than that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because you're not drinking you're not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and cut that's wrong'",

        "'speaker_1': 'what's their intentions and intentions are very very important to me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's like uh i just knew that as hopefully seeing as i grew up in this area and they have women there that aren't attractive at all and i mean i don't i'm not saying that from my point of view because i feel like everybody is beautiful but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you have the single people that don't get any what we call loving'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're there and i don't know what it is that i stopped the situation and now at our hooters the girls don't even have tatas up top'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i think hooters should be prohibited because it's sexually discriminating in my opinion but if you come back to the restaurant i would say like if you have for example like a cook or something and like if you want if you need a new cook and the person who's applying when it comes to the job interview is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the i would say like a bit dirty or something like that i would definitely think cause that also falls on their appearance right i think that should definitely be put into consideration and i i should be'",
