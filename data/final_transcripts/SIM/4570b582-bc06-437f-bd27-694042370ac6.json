        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'look at them like they should'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the i think the problem with social media accounts is that they provide an in-depth view of who you are right but the question is then are you allowed to post something private from another person 's life right so the extreme example of that would be i think if you if you live in your house do you want another person to make a photo of how you sit inside on your couch and sometimes i think social media is crossing that line'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well just as you said with the hospital example UM the time times you by making a photo of yourself you're also showing the private life of somebody else and i don't think that that should be a possibility cause that's still your own privacy right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think they should just be rules'",

        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'actually but what what i will say about that is just remind me of something many many years ago i was actually interviewed on television in ireland i won't tell you what it was about but it was actually for a new some sort of news documentary thing it was about and i actually had to sign a waiver'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh to to give to give it special permission to like broadcast me and i can't remember if i was paid or anything now social media i don't chinese because it's international it it can be like in USA UK ireland or wherever it is there's obviously that they can't have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_3': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it can be but i think if it's in the internet maybe there should be internet specific laws'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but but but then the problem is with internet pacific laws is that it might be incompatible with the laws of a certain country now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i mean that i mean that that's all like the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the logical example if you that if a country doesn't agree with let's say twitter being published so that and and sort out the laws on that then i just block it you know so it's it's so i don't think an internet law would work because it you've got to enforce it with different jurisdictions or or if you can't do that then just block it and nobody can use it anyway'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_2': 'sorry science specific'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rules'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like if you're on facebook versus instagram or tik tok or whatever they should make their own rules'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because it feels like the wild west the internet right now right that's why things were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not gonna be like doing a lot of rules just because they know that introduce a lot more it opens more people to their platform instead of limiting it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and plus and plus of course i i think i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but they're now starting to get in really legal problems right like you know like here the government is starting to crack down on light facebook and sharing you know and mining your information i feel like we're going towards that direction anyway'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that the only thing is that there might be i think sweden had some country in northern europe has quite laxed censorship laws and i suppose really like twitter or something like that could then move the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and could move like where where they're based to sweden or some other country that's got very loose'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and and local internet laws for internet so they can like go worldwide and if they're basing say sweden there and there's laws in sweden that says what you can't be sued for what's published on twitter because we're based in sweden and our laws don't allow especially from somebody from outside sweden but our laws don't allow us to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so somebody for something somebody said on twitter because it's part of swedish law that's actually what happened in ireland when that i think there's there's slightly different'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and nibel lords cause the libel laws in britain are very strict whereas in ireland they're not quite so much and therefore you can actually publish stuff in irelands which can go to the UK but isn't quite covered by UK law so you can't i don't think you can actually use the use the legal route to do it because i just don't think it would it would it would work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah alright unfortunately unfortunately we have run out of time'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's like a loophole'",
