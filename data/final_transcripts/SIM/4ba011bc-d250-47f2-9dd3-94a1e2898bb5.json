        "'speaker_1': 'you know we can all understand and hear each other which is great some meetings it doesn't work out that way you know in some work settings'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so today's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'gonna be a great discussion on the uh topic of actually uh you know restaurants and retail stores hiring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so is it OK for companies like high end retail stores and bars and restaurants'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh to be to hire people based on their appearance and that also includes uh like airlines as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i kind of i myself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'think that a big part of it i do think it's good in a sense that they hire based on appearance a little bit because especially during the hiring like the interview process you kind of want to make yourself look like you would during the job because if they think you're not serious when you're going in for the interview even if you are the most serious person and can make your appearance great how would they know that if you don't show up that way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so is anybody have anything for or against that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or share so but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i uh at some extent i agree with your point but it is only reasonable to have a standard in a place for a personal appearance i guess and professionally made such as appropriate dress accessories and grooming'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for me i would say this is that guy for me i would say a group of you that it's important to show up for that interview with a good impression and to look professional'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that the company naturally when you only have a short time in the interview is going to base a lot of their opinion on you on how you shown up to the interview it obviously shows how much effort you've put in as to how well dressed you've made yourself how organized you've been and that's gonna represent into the workplace when you start the job how organized and how much will you how much effort you put into the job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so it's only natural that that appearance will'",
        "'speaker_2': 'give a certain opinion to the employer that you are you are serious person and are going to to do a good job compared to someone who might turn up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'let's say in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'an extreme example pajamas or sports clothing and and and you may think how much do they want the job and how much do they care about their appearance for my brand as a company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right especially if you're showing up to like a restaurant you know that way or something it might be like whoa'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't disagree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh you gonna be sleeping on the job mister pajamas'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so i was just saying that i that i tend to disagree actually because i do understand the point of light first impressions and everything and you need to dress up and the company 's gonna judge you on it etcetera etcetera but then so now taking the example of like restaurant jobs for example like mcdonald's or things like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that there you go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm the i think the whole point of a person'",
        "'speaker_4': 'trying to get a job is because they are in a situation where they really cannot afford an especially with like the cost of living crisis happening right now and all of that i think it's really important that we do not judge people based on their appearances like and how exactly do you decide what is good clothing or like a good appearance because that's really subjective is in it i understand the point of being well groomed as well but i i think a lot of people may not have the means of doing that and then going to the interview'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so then i just completed disagree because how how how can you decide like what's going appearance and like if they're in desperate need of a job i'm sure that they do not have the means to actually dress well or like get a get a suit or something to for the interview yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it depends on what level you're looking very good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and i don't even think it's like the dress clothes like business casual or something like could be it doesn't mean everybody needs to be in a gray suit but i don't know if my big thing with that is like if somebody 's wearing in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'genes might be fine but what if they're'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ripped and whatnot and like the clothings ripped that's not supposed to be like there's some that are designed that way but then there's some you know that it's like you know maybe it looks like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'he just been you know know outside in that like you don't like i don't know how to under strain the thing because that i mean i'm not saying a whole suit or anything but like just a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know some people might base it like um what's going on with that you know and i understand not being able to afford some stuff i get that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was zack saying something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i was gonna say i i i agree that you know some people might not be able to afford but like you said it the it doesn't have to be something flashy it doesn't have to be like a full suit or anything like that but for me as an employer where i've done interviews in the past you think about the effort that they've brought to the party in terms of what they're wearing it doesn't cost too much to get a shirt or a pair of trousers or as you say a nice pair of jeans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and for me i'm gonna be thinking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whatever are they going to bring to the job if they can't even get some basic clothes together'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to come to my interview you know what what they going to look like when they've they're on their fifth shift of the week and they're tired and how how much pride are they going to give at the end of the day these are brands or companies that want to present a certain image'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they need to look professional at the end of the day i don't think that's too much to ask in my opinion'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm i think it may not be too much to ask when it when it comes to things like maybe being a flight attendant or things like that because i think that entire job is based on like being well groomed dressing up and things like that but i think i think with the with the question that's posed on us i think it's it's a very general one which includes like basically all the sectors like you know retail and things like working in restaurants and being cleanness and things like that now when it comes to those jobs i really don't think that that dressing up should matter honestly so if you're if if you're applying'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the job of a cleaner'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i don't think that that you would still have the means to to get a proper pair of jeans honestly like with the cost of living crisis i highly doubt that they can afford that yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then i'll uh like discrimination based on appearance in such cases can of can be a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like can put people through psychological issues maybe such as like a low self esteem'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they might face'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think we have to be honest to some extent that without it it's impossible to not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh discriminate in some way against someone based on their appearance you you you see someone and you make a judgment on their appearance i'm not to say that you should dismiss them entirely or judge them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as as to exactly what they they may or may not be able to do in a job but we naturally judge people as we walk around and walk around the street and see people you can't completely take that away'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this all has to be sort of considered and the main important thing is that they they are capable of doing the job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm not saying that it should be ruled out based solely on appearance but let's say you have three candidates'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're going to pick the one that interviews the best but also the one that has made some effort that's that's going to take a factor into your decision'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like shows up the best you know kinda'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah exactly it's it's not just what they say and their experience it's also OK they really want this job they've put the effort in to groom themselves and make themselves look the part'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you know that that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'will you would like to think play over into when they are employed down the line'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and it just makes it kinda it it's really general like we've said so it's hard to tell based on you know like depends it depends on the type of job but overall you gonna have at least think about what you could do for it like you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean may not be the best to you know if somebody explains when they get there but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know at least'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like think about what you could do and to at least try now some people can't help it some people can't like you know when it comes to affording and i i get that completely but at least i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know try to show that you tried to do it like uh it's hard to just that makes sense like it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can make an effort without having to spend a lot of money i think is what you're trying to say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i believe that the like it's common our human mind has been wired in some way that somehow when we meet or see a person for the first time who is attractive our mind filled with a positive personality trait about that person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it happens'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah no i completely agree and like so with with the effort thing as well i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again putting in effort is subjective it may not necessarily have to be like the way you dress and how you groom yourself but it may just be in the background research that you've done about the company for example or i don't know and like the referrals you got or like the the networks you have in the company itself it might just be the effort might be in some other place rather than like dressing up and grooming yourself is what i believe'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i don't think the appearance is is certainly the only thing but i think it's a factor certainly if someone turned up for an interview that i was doing and they look great and they've got suit on they they've groomed themselves perfect but when you ask them about the job they have no idea and they're clearly unqualified then you know you're going to dismiss that person as not suitable so it's not the only factor but i think it's for me it's quite important and it's something when i did interviews before'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would always consider a as part of the whole package because there's a lot of jobs are quite competitive now you know there's a lot of people applying for for jobs there's a lot of jobs there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you know you need to try and pick the best of the best'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and unfortunately if you don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like the effort you might not cut the mustard'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well for this kind of scenario to eliminate this kind of discrimination of while screening process i guess of a phone call at the initial stages of screening might be a good way to you know eliminate this kind of situations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are a biased hiring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that is actually i can i can kinda and you say like the phone calls that's what you were focusing on there like phone interviews because we didn't just say see that's actually really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see that's actually really interesting because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it did not say visual appearance and i didn't actually think about that i don't know about you know like i i actually didn't you bring up a really good point but appearance is still probably you know with the with the phone and stuff say it's for remote job especially like ones that i've applied for if if i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know on the interview saying that or you know like if i said yes i can show up for this interview what you know three PM and then i get there whether it's a little late which everybody has stuff come up but or if you get there saying that you can be in a quiet environment and then it sounds like you always got tools or something going like you got something loud in the background like you're watching TV or something that's what i think makes a a difference in appearance too not even just the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know so thanks for bringing that up because that actually reminded me of that that i wanted to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know and so that's that's the type of appearance for in that case for remote base because we gotta consider every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because retail you could still be a customer service remotely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we say are we saying to do a like a screen an audio only interview and and then hire based off of that or just as a first sort of screening step and then maybe it didn't person interview afterwards'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it depends the type of job i think you know like it depends if it's a because if you just do an audio for a home based you know you would base it more on loudness and you know like just distractions and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes for like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that still brings in appearance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so like before like any interview like we are said that the environment should be quiet OK first pose the interview for the initial interview interview phase like i said it could be a good phone call or a through a zoom meeting anything just not a video thing so in that case that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'screening process can be used to you know validate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'validate the qualification and skill or the technical skills that can be tested and once the person who can pass that phase they can move to you know face to face round i think that can also eliminate this discrimination bias hiring'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but then based on what you've said'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know about you don't agree with the appearance being used as part of the process then what is the purpose of the in person interview then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well it's in the case of on site jobs not the remote'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what do you think about when we're talking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'about somewhere like and this is an extreme example hotas have and i'm sure the code that you're probably gonna bring this up or work considering it they obviously have a certain brand and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the whole brand is around the appearance of the waitresses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'without that they don't have they don't have that unique'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as a word for i can't think of it they don't have their unique identity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what are your thoughts on on that is is that appropriate and appropriate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well uh there are industry of which are still challenging that you know for the customer facing industries such as hotel restaurants and bars that do give preference to appearance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in that case like my first point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is important whether it is customer facing role or whenever there is a customer facing role'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you have to be uh i believe that it is important to be well groomed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but then so now i think going back to like the the telephone interview point what i think is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's still gonna be some sort of bias in like telephone interviewing because i mean obviously there's bias on face to face interviewing as well but then even with telephone interviewing i think it might be more pronounced because you can't see the person of course so maybe based on their i don't know accent or just the way they talk for example english might not be the first language of a lot of people and what if they want to get jobs i'm sure that they're they're not gonna be prioritized over someone else who speaks english as a first language and like predominantly english'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you can countries and i feel like it's really important to recognize that as well in in interviews so i don't know if that could that could be a part of appearance as such but i think it does form a very big part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'people i would even hope people wouldn't base that as a factor like if you can you know show that you're or like if you can at least try like if you applied for it in the first place you should already'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i i don't well let's see like what the language thing i don't know that that i mean especially if it's one that it doesn't you know as long as you can be understood like you know in the environment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the applicant should already kinda'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would hope companies wouldn't base like if they if they did it just because they realized there was an accent i mean it probably depends like if it's customer facing and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if they if they interview were can't understand then that would be a little bit but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i don't think they should base it like i personally don't think they should base it on that if they if that person can still do the job and be understood even no matter their accent and whatnot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i would hope they wouldn't do that because that would be a little too much discrimination as far as i'm concerned'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah definitely that's what i think as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i agree and actually i think companies should look at it as a bonus if english is not your first language but you can speak it fluently you you you you know you might have multilingual customers to attract more business and learning a language is not easy it's very difficult i've tried it myself and failed miserably'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and so there's a level of intellect and and again effort so that yeah that should be considered as as part of it but i think as as the code has said it it's important that you are understood clearly and and you are fluent because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'definitely yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know if you're an english speaking role and the customers experience it might be diminished by not being able to understand you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i also understand the struggle where you know my wife is portuguese as their first language she she needed to go in and get that experience to improve her english and so if you don't give them the opportunity to improve then how will they ever get better if that makes sense'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah especially one of the biggest pros is that like here in the US especially is a restaurants you know cause i'm sorry but i'm gonna think especially at you know certain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whether their food chains are just the type of restaurants if there's people from the country where that food 's from working there let's just say no matter their accent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that would really show that they would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have like the best knowledge of it possibly because they're from the country where that food was originating so personally i wouldn't want fully like only american workers at a for example mexican restaurant here in the US or a chinese restaurant or like i wouldn't want just american i'm sorry but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i'd rather have somebody that like it'd be a bonus to have somebody with from a different country there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no matter their language as long as they could communicate with the people at the restaurant you know in the back or like the high end part of it you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah no the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as long as they can communicate sometimes that makes all the difference but that i don't consider an appearance as much i think the more appearance that i was thinking was there you know the way of showing up whether it be in person or remotely like not who they are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as a person as much as it is what they're showing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'language uh will be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'actually uh skill that can be added up in that kind of scenario'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one of the skills'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's like an extra qualification isn't it really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah like it shouldn't be something that is really like looked at for that that you base the entire interview upon so i think yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so yeah no no that if they try doing that i'm sorry but i wouldn't have i wouldn't praise the company for that i i would not give the company very much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that'd be like no you're a discriminating a little bit there if you don't like if that person can still do what you want and if you could still talk to them and they could talk to you then what made them a bad person for the thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like no that that's the limits that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for the yes yes please go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was gonna say what is the dakota i i sorry for word durance if i'm wrong here are you from the states'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i'm from michigan actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes so right now for me it's uh nine thirty AM'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i've been up since about seven'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh lovely i what's your opinion if you've been to hooters'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually OK you mean just like uh like visually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah obviously like they have a certain brand and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm well actually that brings up a that brings up a really good point because it also depends on the type of interviewer because and i know you're asking them in general but i am gonna tell you guys something i can only base it on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what i can hear and taste when i'm at hooters like because i myself am actually blind'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i am actually visually impaired blind whatever people wanna call it you know i'm not offended by anything with that so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so that is another thing it depends the interviewer because i'm if i were to ever interview for a job like interview somebody i would base it on like how much i can hear him and you know the noise more even if it was in person because who am i to judge if i can't see what they look like so they appearance can be many different factors not just visually but the company in general i don't know i've heard about the way people look when they're working there are some and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's like yeah sometimes uh you probably don't wanna have kids there at some points in the day huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that i mean it depends the type of business if that's what you're supposed to do then if people are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'joining that's their choice and'",
