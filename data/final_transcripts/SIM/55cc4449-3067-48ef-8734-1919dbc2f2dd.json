        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so of course my name is brittany i'm your moderator this evening'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the topic of discussion is going to be do you agree artificial intelligence is helping and improving humanity it's going to be a debate style conversation so we are encouraging overlaps and interruptions during the conversation if someone is saying something and you have a bright idea to pitch in go ahead with it do not mind the fact that it may or may not stop them from talking we want overlaps'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not saying we need to consistently do that to each other but there is a certain amount that we need so do not hesitate to button if you need to we'll start with an audio test where we'll introduce ourselves'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and follow up with a quick frame phrase with the phrase being the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i can start that process here my name is brittany and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hi my name 's abdul and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi my name is lula timika and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hi my name is katie and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you for that and just to make sure can i get everyone to let me know what type of device you're using whether it be an open mic or a headset'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm also in an open mic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm using the headset'",
        "'speaker_4': 'come on open mic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you have a headset available'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i do not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'abdul do you have a headset available'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm i'm using i'm using the headset'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh OK so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can you are you able to use ohh well no i guess that's that's where we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'though you're on a all three of you were using'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a headset'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i'm using open mic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and abdul and oluwa tumiki is using in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no you're using open mic caddies using i apologize i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm usually better with this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i need two of us to be on a headset and two of us being open minded possible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'abdul is in a headset i mean i'm open mic and then all the what to me catches in an open mic too so i don't know why you are on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so that that would mean that technically i would be wanting to use a headset but i actually need to be on open mic for this call so i would just keep it this way actually if if it's a problem i guess they'll let me know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so the topic of discussion is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you agree artificial intelligence is helping and improving humanity we're gonna want each person to get at least six minutes of talk time and if possible and we can start whenever you're ready'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah so i think it's done a lot for improving our society well can't do a lot improving our society but also depends on how we use it so we have to use it very carefully so in the case of education we've seen like things like charge ET being used to write essays so i think the benefit of this is gonna force the education system to change'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and like stop all these needless like essays and reports that don't actually teach to do anything because if you can if i can just go online and type into and i you know right and i see the that's like three thousand words long because this subject and get again a there's no point you know you you every shift that a is and B 's so the education system would have to change and improve to teaching students'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you think we could like stop a artificial intelligence from being registered inside of a metal detector'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you think we can stop artificial intelligence from interrupting with metal detectors'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like interrupting or just helping out i didn't understand the question meeting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's a reason for me asking it has everything to do with what he was just talking about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'he was saying that kids in school i'll just explain it then he was saying that kids in school are able to use artificial intelligence to write whole essays for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i know that we can't stop them from doing that at home but i mean parents have been doing their kids projects from the beginning of time anyway so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we would focus on in schools'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that i will disagree because honestly like there's some people like i did my project every single'",
        "'speaker_3': 'homework by myself and now i feel like the process'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes but that's not to say for the people that actually do have their projects being done for them and i know for a fact that actually gets done i've seen it with my own eyes it's great that there's people like you and i that do our own projects but there are some that don't because sometimes parents don't even want their child to actually having the knowledge that that project would teach them so they do it their self'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but i think there's not much you can do to stop AI like it's always gonna be there and then it's gonna give the people that don't want to do it themselves an unfair advantage because let's say their essays and reports are bear the people that do to it themselves do it properly the right way everyone then it's going to force everyone to use the eye to keep to get good marks to keep up so like how do you how do you stop this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well that brings me back to what i was saying if we were if we were focusing on artificial intelligence and education or schooling to stop from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because in the classroom is it's great teacher is going to know what type of homework to send home with the child upon what they do or in a student altogether not just the child a student altogether what type of home network to send that student home with according to how they present themselves and how they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how they participate in class and the things that they do so what i was thinking was umm or or what i was coming up with in my head just now was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if i was seeing students go into school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'being asked questions and typing on their phone the answer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or even hey you guys have thirty minutes to write a two hundred word essay'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that's wasn't sadly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is not long at all that's like a paragraph but the fact that they could just type it in on their cell phones right then and there would is giving them the power of using AI in the school by themselves i know that's being used'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'widely but this is just one topic that i'm bringing up here i do know that that could be stopped that could be nipped in the bud right then and there if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'metal detectors could if if they could have the capability of blocking all artificial intelligence from interrupting its systems and i say this because if you send those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'students through the metal detector and they're not allowed to bring their electronics in the class'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their their devices that they would be typing these things in in on that would nip that in the blood quickly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what about homework'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i understand yes it always gonna say like i mean well i abdul was saying like the system itself has to change like for me at school that doesn't necessarily have to do homework i mean sometimes i have seen this model of schooling in which you don't go with homework you basically do all your school work at school that's what school for right and then you are gonna be living alone or not using the internet as much at school i don't understand what you're saying with the metal detectors'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i don't think as well it will be like a good idea or a major idea to put metal detectors maybe in schools right now there are some schools that they do have because of the yeah like for the social economical reasons or because of the zone or because it's required by the state i don't really know but they some of them they are really have them but the fact that they are gonna implement them just for you know to take your phone i don't think that would be like a great idea i just think that you have to be responsible enough with yourself and with your kid to educate him and say hey you know what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'some schools already have those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you cannot take phone to school phone is just for house or it don't take or the T shirt as well like hey in this class'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's not for me just like me i did i wasn't allowed to have a cell phone so when i got to school my friends let me borrow their cell phones during the day'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i so with the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but the idea is to educate ourselves and educate the during the class you cannot use this the the cell phone and the teacher or somebody sees you using the phone hey you need to get the phone well they need to leave here because like you are using the school i i have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is why we need metal detectors and some of our schools because some of those kids are just so high and mighty they believe they can't have anything to take it from them because that's the way they were raised and they're not gonna change so if someone tries to take their stuff then you have a whole bunch of knives and that's why there's the metal detectors the metal bouncing off of everything is very sure side of problem and considering that most things most problems in life start from cheating and i don't mean in relationships i mean from a per person doing one thing to get further than'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to further themselves quicker because they know they can't get to it or because they don't feel like it or to do it faster than another person stopping the phones in class would stop all of that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would i would say that for we're really just thinking about like things like essay writing and for those kinds of things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no we're talking about artificial intelligence and how if it's helping and improving humanity'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no yeah i know but when we're saying like writing essays that's what we're thinking about because i'll for a lot of school courses a i wouldn't really be that helpful i mean for math you can just say just show the work and that really solves that quick that that issue a lot of stuff is already'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a question and answer like dots and those are like can't really use AI for those because you just you wouldn't have time to but for essay writing that's what usually people are focusing on because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm as a rite aid you need to you need it because you need to at least figure out how to teach people how to think and how to coordinate stuff so i don't i would say that would for that you would probably need to go old school this pen and paper which is which would which would be more difficult for teachers because you know didn't handwriting but i think that's the only way to fix that because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'unless you give people special computers that don't connect to the internet and there's there's no way to stop them from trying to write a i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but if i i don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so with the whole so you have the metal detectors and you have the pen and paper with all metal detector thing you can always do work at home like there's now you can stop you can't do anything stop people using cheating at home using the IIS to do their work at home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but what they do at home is gonna is gonna brother their home life but what happens in school is gonna happen at school for instance there's two points of like to bring up when i was in school i went to a school where they had i believe it was titanium all around the school we couldn't get cell phone service in our school most of the time it depended on your cell phone provider and if they went the extra mile to get you to do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that only counts in high school and middle school in college you can't do anything like that or you're working most of the work in college you can't you don't do work in college you actually do outside your college and your doors'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well those people are gonna run into the situations where their boss is gonna find out they cheated and like i said all problems start with cheating and then they're gonna mess up someones life because they tried they got a degree for something they cheated through and then they ruined someone 's because they didn't really know what they were doing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes so we need to figure out a way to make sure people can't cheat easily'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but what my teachers also did a long time ago i'm not i'm not that young and and i'm not too old either but my teachers let me know ahead of time that that would never work they they presented right at the beginning of the year they said listen i'm one of those teachers if i ask you to take the time to write me an essay i want you to take the time to write me an essay because i'm also the person that has to take the time to put what you turn in into the computer to see if it comes up and she said many people many people have done that she's puts in what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that kid write them in an essay and it comes up on line because they they ripped it from the internet'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but that's that's old school technology now you know have aids that can write like can paraphrase'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it does you can literally you can literally type it into an AI can you please write me an essay and it'll do it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yes i'm saying that so this whole like this whole essay tech like education system we have that doesn't really teach local thinking that just says do this like do this task like not mediocre but you know just do this cookie cart task that you can just get in and we'll do it better than most'",
        "'speaker_3': 'billy sent for me the best the even if i always created the same way i was created it's gonna be a way for us to block either internet cell phone service or it's gonna be a way for us to create a type of device or blood the internet somehow i mean i don't think that you might ninety is gonna be just in a school system just back down for this at the same way it was created we're gonna have to find a way to you know i guess stop it at schools but overall if we're talking about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but only at school but life in general i do think that i has improved a lot of things even for me when i'm doing research or work is hundred percent easier to do it and that doesn't make me stupid or that doesn't make me not qualified to do my job it's just like a tool that i'm using to help myself and there's a lot of people as well who are using this tool for things that are actually worth it or to help themselves either in college or at the job or even at the house and that necessarily mean that it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bad thing or that you are cheating on it's just a tool that humanity created so you can do things easier cause nowadays that's the goal to do every task in an easier way that's what i think and besides all that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i also think that you are gonna need people who constantly will be updating this IA and who constantly do maintenance either on the program or in the features or everything and those people are actually gonna be there people who are gonna have the careers of the future like it right now is one of the most like on the market that they demand more people and more students and they are included even right now in some high schools'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but another countries because it's so necessary right now and that's the future so i do know that eight everything is changing and that's where we're moving forward and that's where we're moving toward so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh my issue with AI yeah maybe well that's it's improving and stuff like that is that for for AI and for a lot of people it's like you don't know what you don't know so for a late for someone who a lay person using like AI prompts it can give you like something say like i remember typing in give me a recipe for clear ice cream'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now if you didn't know that clear ice cream didn't exist and it gave you that it's like wow this is it obvious mistake but if you're a person who doesn't know it's like OK i was gonna follow this all gonna follow this recipe and that's where i think those are the issues is i mean it's good if you don't know what you're doing and you try to use AI you could get like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'very big disasters because because some people we because you don't know the limits are and i'm assuming that like in the future you need you can't just have rely on just like IT people like fixing up their program you need like interplay of people who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah like that they get the money from that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so the thing the problem with that is this is this is a is only gonna be as this is the worst AI is gonna be it's only gonna get better and better and better so that's so if we don't and it's gonna increase it's not going it's gonna increase exponentially it's just gonna keep getting better and better faster than faster so we have to we have to start making changes now because if not we'll see we'll start seeing you know students every students using it because like the the problems with because i'm in college right now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and some lectures i've already started complaining saying no ohh we we know as people using AI in your coursework and stuff like that so it's already become a it's only been out for like a couple of months i'm students already started using it so imagine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i'm going to tell you something interesting like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well if i'm gonna tell you something interesting and read here on appen i'm also in another project that is not this and we are actually trying to charge BT with microsoft so all of the microsoft'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all of the microsoft programs like excel word even microsoft edge like whatever you do your bing search and stuff from now on they're gonna start having chat QT next to it so whenever you're gonna send something out it's gonna be asking you and you're gonna be able to send information directly to GPT to ask questions and that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i'm sorry i have to break it i have the button right here because i don't know if i'm supposed to stop recording when you do that we're not supposed to be talking about other projects i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're confidential remember'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes so i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and just in case like what the the the point of AI is to have everyone have a personalized experience to have a a great lifestyle so if we keep sharing what are the AI is giving for ourselves and our own units that's why we keep ending up with everybody else 's stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but that's fine it's good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'why do you mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm for instance she just told you about a new feature that she's gonna have on her'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on her platform if that was something that they had actually just wanted for her'",
        "'speaker_1': 'after hearing this recording they're probably going to give it to all of us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh i know what you mean OK OK i know what you mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like they might have like tailored that and personalized that for you so like that's why we're not really supposed to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'doing that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's what i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i think so i think it's gonna force a love'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh industries to change yeah i was gonna force a lot industries to change because i know people start exploiting it to make jobs easier and you know doing things that they shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to thus make my biggest problem it has the potential to do a lot of good but also potentially do a lot but depends on how we use it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and what yeah i think a lot of i think a lot of that bag bad it's what i talk about the wholes let me AI is gonna get better and better but it's still like it's still improving and where the when where it's where LAX is the issue because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh people are trying people are trying to brute force it into everywhere without ohh naturally that's people are curious but a lot of companies are trying to brute force it and so you end up getting like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you're and you're gonna we're gonna get a like a period where there's gonna be a lot of people like a lot of job loss a lot of people being left out and then you get like catastrophes happen it's like ohh data loss or or websites breaking because you just dumped you just dumped at an AI out a program on a person who didn't know how to use it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'may not actually those things are gonna be filled up but that's what my concern is it's like people rushing into it thinking it could do it can do AB and C but it can't do B and then the whole thing falls apart'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly with AI being a big thing now i i just i didn't wanna see it but one thing i saw in my mind just now was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our police force like UM what if they get a call that was strictly made on an AI device and there's no person so he's he's then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'drag to a location where there really is no person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but even if you have a i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or there's a person that might actually want to harm them instead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even if you have a included in most of the jobs there's gonna be always like a person or somebody who can like regulate those AI 's and regulate those features like for example my job we don't have AI but we do have something like a personalized system i guess and it kind of does a lot of things on your behalf and i do think it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i was trained for you that's well and it's part of the job is required to use it for a lot of stuff actually you cannot do many stuff without this computer assistant that we have assigned to each of us and it's also allowing the company to pretty much keep track of every month that we do pretty much should be in compliance all the time if we do something that is not a step we skip a step that system is gonna tell you the system also is gonna tell you you have a form or something missing and sometimes it's so many rules that we have to follow that their system is actually great'",
        "'speaker_3': 'migrate to light i love it and it also helps the company to make sure that you are doing things right so and this assistant is regulated as well by one guy that regulates all of the regions or all of the franchises that we have in this region and every compliance or every alert it goes through him and he checks it out and sometimes he does call and then you explain to him but he's always a person regulating that behind a robot you know what i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i definitely agree with that i believe it could help tremendously umm when when thinking about artificial intelligence i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it it might be becoming cliche for me myself but i just the way that it's i'm already aware of the situation i'd like other people to be aware of the situation also is there the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's devices in the typical american home now such as the the home assistance like i homes and echo of the amazon echo dots the google whatever those are next or nest that you can just simply ask it a question and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it tells you what to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i like those things although i have had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'very bad answers from things like that uh and it makes me wonder like if i'm not in a room and someone else in my house ask it a question will it be just as rude or threatening to those people in those situations no i don't believe it's improving humanity i do believe that it is testing humanity but it might not always be improving the situation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for instance uh some people 's a i called them profane words like the B word and this comes from the regular treatment of how the person treats their device if every every day that person comes in the house and it's like hey be word i'm home well two days later when you're AI is like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you ask it what should i eat for breakfast and it's like i don't know but you word you can't blame it cause that's who you taught it to be that's who use that's the that's the environment you said that they were in you have to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'try like you said before it's a personalized experience for each one and you yourself personalized experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so so should we so who gets the blame there is that they i said the person who's who's accountable for its actions'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'both you you you can write contact for that if you have one of those things in your house the best thing you can also have as a security camera that watches all the time so you can take that footage and you can put it you can give it to the manufacturer or send it in where it needs to be sent in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because typically i'm not a married person i did used to want to get married but i i find that in a situation like that if me and my partner me and my spouse were in a situation and we're like we don't even know which one of us are correct right now we could look at that device and be like so this is the problem and we this is what we need the answer to that device then becomes your marriage counselor you have it backed up by your security camera you don't have to call up nine down the street and ask her you don't have to call dave and be like you don't understand what this thing just did'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you can keep it inside of your home'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but can you trust'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know how'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what was that day are going to so like do you know how it's processing all this how do you know that data staying in your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the one thing is is that a i can't take your date if you keep relying on other people if that person say you do go to a marriage counselor and that marriage counselor knows that one of the participants is worth a whole bunch of money and the other one just doesn't understand it they might tell you everything to fail just so they can keep getting what they know they can get out of that one person and a i can't get any of that from you guys'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but it the recording that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do you love also the like do you lose also the human feelings sometimes i don't understand but that's way too straight or way too square thinking well i'll say my side well i think that you also need like that human interaction sometimes in that case of a marriage couple and there are some other things as well that i cannot replace like in my case i wouldn't say like i can take a decision for example in a medical field where somebody is connected or somebody you know and then the ID is gonna take the decision for the patient or the decision'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and on behalf of the family or two will disconnect this person or tell this person keep leaving or there are as well things in the law for example that you have a lot of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like empty spaces in the law that you can kind of twist and if you have an API that think that they can do this that i don't really think so because there's like human being smart and human taking advantage and human thinking that actually can twist kind of those words so it can work in to their advantage so i think that even though if we have a i it's still gonna be a human part that we're gonna need for certain'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cases'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thinking of twisting words and me using the word marriage for this typically i'm a typical american uses the word mary for someone that's happy not married but like ohh look they're jolly they're married they're the word mary just like the actual word i'm not i can't say it but the actual word mary M E R R Y it means happy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you talked'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i was thinking about more like law we're talking about whenever we do the laws and then it's like really empty spaces that you can play with and then do a lawsuit or you know even on taxes there is like empty spaces that you can use like we have about eight hundred pages on the tax code and there is a lot of things that count there but people don't read and i i sometimes it's doing that job for you but they are not gonna do it as much as a tax person is gonna be able to know because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know we know stuff that some people they are just not aware and that's how people get away with taxes in that case'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but yeah but but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'talks yet yeah but so it could help it could help do mundane task like you were seeing reading like legal documents and summarizing them to people that are do understand that that could be the application of the cause not i i don't know about you but i don't read you know wherever says i understand and sign legal documents i really most people don't read those because i know i don't for sure you can that be something on AI does a task that's mundane that people don't want to do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then it'd be too expensive to hire to hire like a legal expert that could be at a task i could do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'summarizing big with documents'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but then the the eye is not gonna replace the legal expert that after that if they sue you or if you sue like for example and then that empty space that you forgot to sign or that thing that you agree on sometimes everything that you sign on even on the agreements they do have like legal voids and that's what i mean like do you still gonna have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'another thing that i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wait wait wait the bin'",
        "'speaker_1': 'programming'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because we we don't understand how AI works like we can't ask her how it came to decision'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it just does it's a bunch of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you can actually try it and sometimes it will actually walk you through how it came to that decision'",
        "'speaker_4': 'program actually comes up with some of it would probably help like with those blind spots and seeing like what it's weekend and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think that will probably help people get well not help people get more comfortable with it but i guess that help i think that would have probably helped with those blind spots there's a lot of AI right now because a lot of companies are we are trying to are trying to keep it black box so that they don't give out information to their competition but like seeing how the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i think it'll the the picture is gonna be interesting because as i say by people finally put AI in places where it's where conflicts that happen like law and and medicine and those are at i have a lot of interest in medicine because people like ohh cause you think of people search up things on like google now let's see where they go with AI and try to pick up their symptoms which it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it would be good but then if someone gets something wrong or are they gonna sue the system'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_1': 'first'",
        "'speaker_3': 'reliability it's always gonna be well the companies are always gonna try to blame liability on the user like whenever you agree to use these then you're ready to use it on your own terms that's how it usually goes so if something happened'",

        "'speaker_1': 'doesn't even have a phone on it so you're like what the heck could i do to make this call someone that's real that's really there you really signed that like that's you pushed OK OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so when'",
        "'speaker_3': 'change your agreeing and and you're also giving our privacy many of the time like a lot of the times you're paying and this is what i was saying about the legal boys like those ones i mean for me me that i maybe seen cases and stuff i do think that AI will miss that human i'll say'",

        "'speaker_2': 'so so in terms of liability who would be held liable because you can't hold the cause it's not sentient it's not human it doesn't it doesn't really care you know it's just a it's just a machine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it depends on what happened it depends on what happened honestly so if your'",

        "'speaker_2': 'you heard the programmer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but that's what i'm saying like if you literally press if you literally press they i accept the terms and conditions and you start using the program the liability is not gonna be on the programmer or in the company the liability also always gonna be there'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'correct correct correct correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i would say that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those are that's a really good use for it but naturally i'm always thinking'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean if it will be good if the companies are just selling your data but there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'd be great i think it'd be great to go with a pair of headphones that could massage your feet but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what do we think about AI 's in arts i know that there's a lot of there's a lot of confusion maybe anger maybe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'go thankful i didn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about how E I R A I bites uh dismantle like the current art industry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like i think the biggest problem is that is a lot of these areas they consent to their are being used cause so all these guys need lots of lots of data to be trained'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the and the the the they didn't ask iris to use their art to train the CI so i think that's the biggest problem'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i've been are that it could be having it in art'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh umm it could be good and bad both but to give an example of both a good situation would be say you're like i don't have any ideas and it you type in your favorite colors and it gives you like a palette of a mural or a collage or of just just things that could give you ideas to stop your artist artistry block that's the good version but the bad version is if they if it's allowed to say things like if you could like type in'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm i don't see that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you say you could take away jobs from artist or like i don't understand you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is cheated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's cheating'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK you see those and yeah but that's the same like how do you get around that how would you like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and it's not just about relationships like i said it was like i i tried in three three different dudes things uh and then in the world of art if i were to put it out there one of those men would see it and be like ohh man she made this for me and the other ones like nah she made that for me and the other one was like no she made it for me and me knowing that i did it for all three of them i'm just gonna be with the one that does the most extravagant or not i wouldn't but like most people like i'm gonna be with the one that has the most extravagant thing for me thinking that i made it for them in particular'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how do you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no catastrophic in a bad way no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but that's that that comes down to the human beings the guys just the tools just doing what's tool to depends on how people use it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes which is why most AI i guess i i believe like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they tell you i don't know about certain things like if you ask it about yourself probably it doesn't know you cause it tells you it's not a person so it can't really tell you how many strands of hair you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i heard that likes to avoid such sensitive topics because it doesn't get in trouble and i think that's more of a of a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the companies trying to save face and i'll try and get in trouble with the public'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now in this in this situation i did say that the person they didn't have to input'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the favorite teams'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because a i would already know who you're around'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and what you're building with those people i did strategically put into that i inputted day bob and john 's favorite colors but i did not need to put in their favorite teams all i did was ask it to put their favorite teams into the collage it does that itself'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how would how we didn't know that though and that's it had your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because if you have like i said you're home devices your home devices know who's come who comes in and out of your house it's automatic it's it's there for a service so when you invite someone over it's automatically gonna start trying to help them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nothing that's a privacy issue you can there should be laws'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and it's also a business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the aid is awesome a privacy issue'",
        "'speaker_3': 'he's also like a partnership issue because i don't see well i don't know how it's gonna work right now because they have the rights of the chat deputy and the AI they have it within different companies and then most of the people either have alexa there is owned by amazon and then they also have the city that is owned by apple they will have to get away or a device that has the three features like a device that records in your house plus that device that also connects to the IA plus the device so they can actually know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but we each person so i will have to be also kind of monopoly i guess or the companies just join them all together so they can create something that actually works like that but what adult was saying of inputting your own information that's also true i mean AI is not gonna work unless you give them what guidelines to follow so it's considered cheating maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i had my thing set up to wear like so me and my partner we had to work and at a time we were working different shifts so i would set my things up to where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'd let it know i won't be here when i get back when he gets home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'remind them that i want him to do what he said that he wanted to do and do that other thing for him it did it itself like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i know it works'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm OK also that's like a depend on personal choice like you do that right but for example i don't have any smart devices on my home at all so it's also that human side people now that they wanted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm i apologize i'm sorry we have actually exceeded these thirty minutes that we were supposed to be debating'",
        "'speaker_3': 'alice sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if you'd like we can continue because i think we have up until an hour would you like to continue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i've gotta go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but do we have to end it now or can we do you have to leave at the same time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or it's a lot it was my last call of the day so i just figured that we can go the whole hour if if the if you'd like to but if you have to go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well we'll stop the recording and i will thank you for your amazing wonderful inputs and your insights they were all great the the we we all see things differently and what different personal things on our devices and and home lives and outside of home lives also personal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'privacy and personalization are kind of butting heads at the time but hopefully we will find a way to smooth that out'",
        "'speaker_3': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'm fine for now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i believe in my private homes versus public homes is a thing but you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you and i'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording when you're ready to leave the room you can just push the red leave button with the phone icon at the top and instead of the X please do not push the X because if you push the X up top they might not pay you we might we might not be able to pay you'",
