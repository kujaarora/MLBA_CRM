        "'speaker_1': 'but i know what you're saying i know what you're saying'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that was fast food but yeah because i like i said i grew up on a farm and we grew everything i mean and anything that we ate basically was organic because we didn't use like fertilizer we just used the ground and then as far as any type of protein we ate we raced it and then we ended up killing it so yeah and then two you look at things and things have changed because as a family we sat down to eat together because my parents wanted to make sure that we had a meal and nowadays it's like you said'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by the time you get off work and then kids are trying to do homework they're coming in they really don't feel like eating maybe they wanna eat macaroni and cheese versus a salad i mean because the macaroni and cheese would taste better than a salad so i mean'",

        "'speaker_1': 'right well and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so you're not everybody grew up on a farm that that everybody you know that you can do that some people that you know they live in the city and they don't even know what it even takes to have a farm or how to grow anything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right but that's where the education comes in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes well i mean who do you have that those gonna come educate i mean i know they've got the you know you've got your nutritionist and stuff like that but i mean they're expensive too some of them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'lack of education'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but another thing is too is now where i see a problem with the obesity where parents may be able to control it but some of them have to have their kids on computers and laptops cause a that's where they do their school work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or their phones that's where they do their schoolwork but that's also too unfortunately nowadays that's become a babysitter for kids because parents have are working later they're bringing stuff home all the time it's not like you leave the office at five o'clock and it stays at the office it comes with you so instead of those companies'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean and to some people have two or three jobs i mean just to make the ends meet so yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just to survive correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so instead of being outside playing because nowadays we can't just send our kids into the front yard'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the play because it's not safe in some air and a lot of area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is not no ma'am it is not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this is very true unfortunately'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where we played outside and like you know where my kids were blessed we live on a double cold de sac and everybody's been here for twenty some years so we all watched each other 's and raised each others kids especially outside somebody one parent was always outside watching all the kids'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you don't have that now that luxury now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know because people are trying to work and like you said make ends meet and it's you know i don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't i don't know how i i envy parents that have say three or four kids and and still you know can find the time to to even spend any time you know because there's just so much going on and so much is changing and adding and and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and another thing related to a subject that we learned that we did earlier you know about all this testing and stuff in school they concentrate on that so much that recesses gotten taken down you're lucky to get it two times a week now you have PE maybe one day a week where when we were growing up you were out at recess for like thirty minutes and you did this and you did that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but they don't have those luxuries anymore'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because they feel like they're not necessary in school they feel like it's an unnecessary evil i mean they don't wanna go outside and play with kids they don't even wanna talk to kids in the classroom half of the time but they don't and that's another thing with the obesity thing it's not necessarily a parent thing but when you're going to school if you don't have that activity of course you're gonna gain some weight'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we played every day outside and i mean to the point where i mean our teachers would usually play kickball with us i mean nowadays that's just unheard of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and you know and with the virus people can't go to school so they don't have the recess and they've got all the video games and and things so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now i teach i teach girl'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but they were inside they were inside doing school work the older ones were passing the younger ones around from person to person so that they could all do their time and the parents were trying to work at home too and it's just it's easier to say OK i know where my child is they're sitting right beside me on a piece of electronic instead of being out in the backyard playing or running around'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right they're safe and i you know and and you're in the middle of something i'll just grab you a snack or you know it's it's basically it's easy easier to do that than it is to get up and you know to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's a lot easier to grab a bag of chips than it is to cut up a banana or fruit or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'vegetables for them to eat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the chips taste better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah they do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i would rather have a cooking some chips versus having a salad i mean i eat healthy but if i had the choice to keep weight down here i would i yeah i'd have a cooking some cookies and some chips that probably would be my everyday go to meal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes let's see my kid he he i and i'm guilty of it he'll go grab him chips or cookies or whatever but he's one of those he's he's just tall and skinny and i was when i was a kid now i'm making up for it now because now you know i'm getting the weight but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's much better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not obese or anything but there you know it also has a lot to do with all the pollutions in the air because you know or or you're even your body itself when it changes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's not i mean i don't believe at all that the parents you know it's their fault or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i am'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean there are there are some parents that just completely neglect their kids and they're like here eat this but for the most part no it is not bad parenting it's society it's education it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'straight well they're stressed out and yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stress'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and these kids are these are kids are worse stressed out than we ever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they are they like when i was in school OK if you had a if you got to fight with somebody it you fought in the parking lot it was over you don't to worry about nowadays you gotta worry if somebody 's gonna bring a gun or knife or ten people are gonna jump one person and it's just it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hey'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ridiculous nowadays and that you know i believe that does go back to society and kids and parents that are scared of their kids i i don't understand that i mean i just don't because if my kid raises the hand to me we gonna have some issues right then and there they're right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think that that goes back to good parenting though you know you can't you can't start raising your child when they turn sixteen you gotta start from the cradle on up and then two the thing with this nutrition stuff i mean i don't know about you guys but when we were coming up all of us were taught how to cook so i can remember as young as ten years old i mean i was in the kitchen cooking a meal for a family of seven so i mean the the cooking thing has followed me through my life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because if anybody comes to my house there's a meal for them that's pretty much healthy but good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right but see there there's two you you were raised on a farm as you know i was to kind of but i mean i can go out and grow something if i need to but there's kids that excuse me that you know like your parents weren't they've been city you know city folk all their life and they don't know how to grow anything or which i i think they should because like we were saying earlier'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hi'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the southern one you know if if what's the technology say all of it dies tomorrow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can you go out and you know grow your own food like you would be able to and a lot of people don't know the first thing about it and so it'd be hard for them because they're used you know a lot of them like just go to mcdonald's and stuff and and it just it'd be hard i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have people with her'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's my package deal or whatever another another problem'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hey'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it would be very hard and that's probably why it doesn't happen more so now because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh people probably are nervous about what would happen if they started a doing things differently and their lifestyles for instance you just said if everything shut down miss jacqueline would know how to to grow her own things and the first thing that came to my mind was well maybe i could be the one that helped her get things to other people and the other people ask if they could have help but at the same time in the back of my mind i'm like that's also an issue because the person that's growing those things might be like i have to actually do this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know how to skin a chicken'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'strategically because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if everything shut down how long is it gonna last for what i even have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right it's it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'scary thought'",
        "'speaker_1': 'crazy it is it is and now you know with technology growing like it is you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's it's just too much sometimes it's too much sometimes i think but yeah i i parents like say all parents do the best they can and that's that's all you can ask is do what you can and do the best you can for your kid i mean put your kid you know i put my kid above everything and not all parents do some it's money some it's a person or some it's just themselves but you know each parents different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and as you know i don't get into anybody 's business about their kids unless it's you know they're they're being abused or or you know something like that but it's it's hard on everybody i mean it's hard on any parent or non parent because you know to me i would i'd want to know miss jacqueline your you know your views because you don't have kids and it's easier for someone that you know doesn't to give me you know to say hey it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i see all this going on and what do you think because i have a kid you don't then you know what are your views on it because i'm not going to be able to see everything you know the whole view of it because i do have a kid and i i'm not think what's best for my kid you know is is what i think which i mean you know what i mean it is but getting feedback from someone that doesn't you know everybody should take that into account'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like this is what you guys look like to me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know like you and maybe that'll help'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i don't know i'm just i don't understand some parents and i guess'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well it's another it's a good thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i believe that actually for a person that doesn't have kids and i don't want to believe that they don't do anything in their life because that's totally wrong but you have to you get to the point where it's like well they don't have kids we've been busy trying to we've been ripping and running with that like a chicken with your head cut off trying to figure out what to do with these little students we created and you see these people don't have kids and moving past the part where i wanna help like dang do they not want it or like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has their own because we're all you know earthly people and we're all here together they just haven't you know made any out of their uterus yet from that they popped out or whatever they might do i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they may not be able to have kids'",
        "'speaker_2': 'really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but they they get to see things from a perspective to where it's just them as a human and like their family and they're like well this is what i do for everyone so they don't really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my thoughts are this because i can deal with anybody from yale to jail and with the type of work that i do every day i do deal with people from yale to jail and i see the different perspectives from people so i mean for the most part a lot of parents now are parents are beginning to be younger and younger and so if your parents didn't instill those healthy food values in you then it's gonna be hard for you to instill those healthy values in your children'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but another'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and their children and so forth and so on a lot of times people are just trifling for lack of a better word i mean they can get into the kitchen and go cook because some people and i'm not trying to i'm not trying to pinpoint or downgrade anybody but a lot of people i see out here have food stamps and instead of them buying healthy stuff with their children they rather sell them for something else or they're gonna go to the grocery store and they're gonna go to the freezer part and throw everything in there where you can just microwave it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'amen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'rather than getting some fresh fruits and vegetables instead of getting maybe some milk or some juices without sugar you see a whole basket full of sodas and so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on that note i do think that some obesity comes from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it comes from the parent because again maybe they weren't taught or maybe they weren't taught but then when you've got three or four kids'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is difficult'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on the flip side of that i've seen some people who have six or seven kids and they're sitting down at the kitchen table and they're all eating healthy so again i guess it just comes back to maybe how you were raised or what you believe in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that that's very true'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i think it's a good thought and if you're out in town and it's probably a lot easier to do that out in town where they can physically see you paying for the situation and i wouldn't say do this all the time but i'm a parent to wear and i'm already my pocket is already like brittany don't do it but having these types of conversations makes me see that i wanna do things differently so if i take my kids to kings dominion or an amusement park i know they have those souvenir cups i wanna get my kids souvenir cup and yes they can have a drink of their choice'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the model was not alcohol but when i'm not refill i'm i'm paying for a refill well actually know what i'll do is i'll i'll buy the the the souvenir cup and i'll tell them look we're drinking water the next drink you get and you can have a drink of your choice and we're here that's what we're doing and i want you to know that after you finish that drink it's getting refilled with water so if they if they see me actually physically pay for water in public for them to drink they might actually consider like why is she doing this is it is it really not because it's free i thought she was just doing it cuz it was free'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but also too water is'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right i mean i you know it and another thing that's sad to see is and i do but i don't want to say it's bad parenting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but when my daughter was younger'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who did the easter bunny and this child was as big around as she was up she couldn't even walk off a curb she had to hop'",

        "'speaker_1': 'come on that is just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that's the thing they're putting so much stuff into food now to make it grow bigger and faster and so then our bodies aren't designed for this stuff that they're putting in the food so thus you have little girls walking around looking like grown women and little boys are just so husky and then on top of that if you're not monitoring what your child puts in their mouth as far as like drinking sodas or having sweet tea all the time that adds on that additional weight too and i know all of this y'all i'm not a size six'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",

        "'speaker_1': 'two'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i'm not used to be but i'm not now but there's a difference when you are drinking water only or mostly water versus everything that has sugar in it so when i'm out with my nieces and my nephews they know that if we go to eat somewhere first of all you're gonna have some fruits and vegetables and we're gonna drink water now if you want some dessert after that i don't have a problem with it but we're gonna put something healthy in our bodies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",

        "'speaker_1': 'exactly eat mud cakes and all that you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but at the same time that we could do that safely we didn't have to worry about somebody driving by and serving us in a car'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes that that is also very true and sad unfortunate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which happened to me like sixteen why didn't get shoved in the car but i was kidnapped when i was seventeen it was kind of rough'",
