        "'speaker_3': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i think we'll be able to have a really good discussion on that and i'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i had a question if you guys thought that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'could that be uh based on the type of job you know like such as medical jobs or like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah like seven anybody have any comments'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it actually depends if you're talking about if it comes to medical well towards the medical field it's better you have a college intention a college degree before you come to that medical field because you can't just come out and see because you're experienced in something about let's say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my dealing with first things you're good at medical and medical field but then there are some other works that don't really require a college degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then at the same time it's much more advisable to get in walking experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah definitely with a medical degree that's something that you need to learn such intricate details of things like the vascular system that's things that you can't really learn on the job that's that's definitely a topic where it seems that it'd be hard to argue not to have a medical degree or a degree in order to be able to do something like you know medical involves'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah cause one mistake you know like we all know that uh one mistake he like you you gotta be right on top of it was a job like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know in the medical field and that's kind of why i was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sink and personally you know i i think it might'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes a college degree is important but i also think along with that college degree what i was thinking with this one is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like on the job experience is also really important depending on the type of doctor like it's good to have that but you shouldn't you need at least a college degree but the more experience you know like the more experiences you have that will help you in the medical field especially'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'along the way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean if we if we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i can agree with that too'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i feel like if we if we shift our focus from like the the medical field i feel like in general experience is required for everything be it like business or psychology or anything else because if you just look at it sure you have a degree but then that's not really gonna help you in the real world so i feel like it's it's really important that that we have that experience and in that sense if you think of it a college degree is almost useless if i can say that because if you don't have the real world experience like a piece of paper'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is not gonna get you so far in life yet'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you do need that human interaction'",
        "'speaker_3': 'area as well but i i would find it hard to trust the doctor who couldn't you know name all my bones which is kind of hard to learn on the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh yeah i mean or if you do you're gonna be so you know bogged down with info that it's gonna be like do i really need a OK which one was this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know and it's gonna bring down the confidence and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah see that's in it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but then and the classroom do you don't get that you know that true human interaction learning you know how to connect with people and that's another thing doctors are very cold and that is because they do spend a lot of time in the classroom just learning those absolute finite details of you know how to be a doctor or you know how to how to know the field that you know they're specifically studying for and it does tend to make them a little cold since they don't have that a lot of that one on one with a human practicing and it's just a lot of their faces in books'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and that's like it's nice there to talk to people like uh even when you're just as friends emailing as way you know that kind of connects like with the emailing and messaging isn't the same as talking to somebody whether it's in person or just over the phone you feel that interaction and it just feels more you know personal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so it's good to have that with the experience as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm and that's why i think safety is really important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when it comes to the medical good when it comes to the medical field experience the debt it's truly practicals done in college because there is no way you just be in college all through the seventies plus while studying the medical field and there's no practical being done that practical is there experienced not where they bring a live animal and actions dissecting it or you couldn't identify which organs which in some certain animal that's the experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm for the medical field'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's all for me it's like kind of in love experience because someone who hasn't gone through that degree that college degree can't be practicing at home'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most people many people would meet anyone without a college degree practicing under a medical field'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i i do agree but like from from what i see from our conversation so far like we're really heavy on like the experience which which i definitely agree with that that the experience is necessary like before degree but then for for fields like psychology for example it's really important for you to have that degree as well sometimes because you will virtually know no theories or or like no therapy models if if if you don't learn in your degree and you might be able to learn that with like experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like observing therapy sessions but again they're like a lot of ethical issues with observing therapy sessions that people might not really allow you to you know sit in therapy sessions with with the counselor so i think that that is the aspect of having a degree and learning so much is really important in other fields for example even with business right yes obviously the the experience is important but knowing business models and seeing how other companies have failed using certain business models what to use what not to use is again something that's really important'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and that's that's why i feel that you know sometimes now the medical field i can get strict you know people want you know people with great experience but i personally was a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i did a major in broadcasting in communication and you know that's not really a safety concern if that makes sense like you know i think that's more like the degree my degree yes i may not have a ton of broadcasting experience but it's because some of the places i'll tell you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they say oh that we want you to have five years radio experience or something and i'm like well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'when i couldn't even get any because even volunteering i couldn't get something after college it's like how am i ever gonna get that experience there being too strict with certain fields but maybe not strict enough with others you know i think the degree is really important but some people just don't seem to think that like not not you guys but i mean like some companies don't seem to think ohh just cause he hasn't worked for five years he's not gonna be where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well for us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i just feel like getting a degree makes you more job ready it shows your your dedication it shows you know your willingness to sacrifice for you know the field that you're trying to go into'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and that's why i think i completely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i really get where you're coming from with that and you get what i'm it's just like especially with those fields like i say that now any job can be fun but i mean the less like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like the ones that don't have as many like safety concerns and stuff like and especially like computers right and like the computer degrees i don't even have a computer degree and people are telling me i should be paid for it but i can't because i don't have the degree so companies won't trust that like i've been helping people for a long time what's up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah the ones where people 's lives are at risk yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'probably when it comes to let's say says about software and hardware'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with sometimes but most times the degree doesn't really matter because you can see someone with a degree in computer science but yet'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from what without a degree can outsmart them in cyber security for instance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep he gets it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when you come when we are looking at the experience now experience is better than degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the more you practice the more you learn the more you work on each programming language the more you become better at using it and applying this other land'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so some people can go through college get the degree yes it's only one language they learn and based on computer science right now it's only one language they left out of all the programming languages we have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'computer science device the vast body it's not something you can see you know everything about it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm sleepy to do just major only in one part of this and then someone else who is just me can you know take up like a youtube course or something man practice practice and practice and become better than some of the college degree so for me at this point i feel like experience when it comes to computer science is actually better than college degree because most college they won't actually would like to take you deep into that cyber security they won't take you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm with you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is needed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah there's there's definitely fields where the degree just doesn't make sense i've recently relocated myself about two thousand miles from where i'm from and so i've been in looking you know for a new job and i was looking and on these job sites they're telling people who are going to do a customer service position need a bachelors degree which is insane because you don't learn customer service skills getting a degree which is just crazy that you would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'especially depending on the field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's just a customer service handling handling phone calls from customer complaints what why do i need a degree for that that is absolutely insane'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i saw similar wondering saintly i think i think it was it was something related to midwife so there was an entire five year degree on being a midwife and you could argue that they're literally doctors but they don't get the title of of being doctors which is insane because they study for five years and then literally just medical doctors just that they don't have the title of it because they know all the procedures they know what to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and that's that's just that especially for customer service now if it's certain ones like you know the medical billing or billing questions and stuff that you have to but for a general customer service'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like an ma a medical assistant something like that yeah if you're even if you're doing a i even think medical coding doesn't need a degree that's something you can learn on field'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that's it just depends there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah that's why i just really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i did i would not i would not want a doctor working on me who did not have a medical to read that i can that what i can sail down the road with that one i i would not i would not trust a doctor with experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh no no uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry i've already got one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry i've already got one uh you know not complication but i mean i myself am actually blind visually impaired whatever we wanna call it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'these days because it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so i really don't need you know something else happening as well and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know if we got to make sure people know what their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know know what they're doing know what they're telling you and not just telling you stuff because they think it's right it has to be right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah to be fair like this i i do agree with like yeah a medical doctor like degrees and things but i think these these days just decrease for everything because there are those many people going into higher education and like everyone thinks it's it's the only possible route after after high school which is which is a huge problem so now there's like degrees for like the most random things on earth and i i don't understand like you mentioned customer service which is which is just bizarre like these jobs existed back then and people were doing OK without getting those degrees we're just experience or like they find their way into it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but now there's just a degree for everything basically'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and then there i think the specific ad that i was thinking of the job was they wanted you to have a a four year business degree like what do i need a business degree to talk to customers on the phone who are upset that just makes no sense and i can't tell you how many of my friends have art degrees who are then going i can't do anything with this or english degrees which you get out of school you have an english degree all they do is expect you to teach and you're like well i don't wanna teach you're like why did you get a degree in english'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it also wasn't agree a degree in teaching english you know there's a difference there too because english could help you be ohh i don't know a proofreader or you know believe it or not there are those you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and like you know somebody like for magazines or something like that's considered english yes that could be considered writing classes but english in general you have to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know do you guys get what i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like that that's people just try to single it out to one job it's like ohh heck no cause teaching'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'depending on the type of teaching you gotta have you know even a bigger one depending on the field and that's one thing too'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and myself i have a degree in applied mathematics and i have literally never used it i don't know why i got that degree i don't know why it's been four years doing that but i have been bartending most of my life so i always make a joke i'm a bartender with a math degree and literally haven't done anything with it didn't really think through what this degree was gonna pan out for i guess in the long run thought maybe i wanted to teach didn't wanna teach down the degree is kind of useless'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well you didn't number outside you didn't keep track of the numbers of you know drinks that everybody was having you know single it out that's about the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah exactly i'm i'm pretty good at giving exact change though'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well hey that's mathematics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because you know if you don't give the right amount back or if you give two of uh much back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there you go you you technically did use it i mean it's not applied man you know like but it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's kind of that little bit like you know we don't think about it but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah i just had to throw that in there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it does develop our thinking to some extent though like like that's the whole argument like for teaching like subjects like science and math until like high school like it develops your brain to think a certain way like it uses some analytical thinking some critical thinking skills that wouldn't have otherwise been developed hadn't students been taught math and science for example so like so like just just teaching the brain to work that way and like push itself'",
        "'speaker_4': 'developing that thinking i believe the soft soft skills that we learn from the degrees are are what we take back and take into the working world more than like obviously the theories and everything that's completely useless yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah like the ones that have been around for or that have been not contradicted but you know just kinda changed so much it's like well then what's the point of learning some of the things i mean if we wanna see how they've evolved that's one thing but how much of those are we going to use'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i'm very interested in in in a in a kind of an aspect question on this and since there's you know two went two women and two men and the conversation something that i knew in my recent applying for jobs and just reading over there's various articles and things i had found out that women are less likely to apply for jobs that they don't meet those requirements say if there's an education requirement women are far less likely to apply for those jobs than men which i find very interesting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm wondering if you know either of either the men in the conversation kind of have a perspective on that as to you know would you apply for a job that you seem to be less likely prepared for or don't match that job description of education because i know i just straight up won't if it says you need this education i just won't apply for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's me a lot of times i'll admit it i especially with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now ones that i'm definitely not wasting anybody 's time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh is ones where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if it's in another state and it's hybrid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then i can't do it like you know because i can't drive and therefore i'm not gonna know if it's you know fully remote that's one thing but you know that's what kind of even if it's not degree requirements if it's even something as simple as not driving'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know but yeah i i a lot of times because i think it not scares you but it's like ohh well it might even gonna be accepted like i mean sometimes if it says the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for a furred then i might apply'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i just feel like if it's says you know requirements you know a degree in this field i just go well i mean i know it's just a couple clicks but i'm not even gonna waste my time but it was just interesting because i read an article about how men are more likely to apply for certain jobs even if they don't meet the requirements'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but preferred'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well people also gotta understand men aren't indestructible either nobody's indestructible and so you know but what's up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you're good at something and then that's it you're experiencing this particular field i want to apply for a job and they say you require a degree well for me since i'm experiencing it also apply either way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the objects difference i know the working principles everything i still apply whether i have a degree on it or not i still have life and i'll putting those experiences like if they give me they ask for water and what can i do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'll put this in i put it in for them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it may come from like women just sticking to rules and think like that like i i'm i'm trying to think of a psychologically because i mean i have i have a psychology degree i'm doing a masters in psychology in now so everything 's just psychology to me so i mean it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'congrats on that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'awesome'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so i was just thinking like maybe it just comes from like women just thinking to rules all the time because there there's quite a lot of literature available on that and it just says that women just like to abide by rules a lot more than men do so i think if it just says that you know a certain qualification or something then yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's an interesting perspective yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because it's just like i don't know the rules thing i'm just one that's i i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not like a lot of you know what people would say other men you know in quotes because i kinda do rules too because i'm just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it just depends what it is but i'm always you know paying attention to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know new not trends but like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think it's just i'm i'm not one that just does anything just cause i can or you know like just cause i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah well with somebody gonna say something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i had just muted and unmuted my mic while i was coughing sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no that's alright'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and then i like how a lot of companies now who are understanding that these degrees aren't as important as you know they were once purported as being they offered their own you know on the job certifications or things like that that they allow you to progress more in the company you come into the company without a degree you leave the company go to a new company and you have all these certifications on top of the experience but then some of those new companies'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they'll be like well you still don't have a degree and i'm like well i've been in this field for fifteen years and i feel like i know it pretty well'",
