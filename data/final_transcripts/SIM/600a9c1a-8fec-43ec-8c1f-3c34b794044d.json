    "Is animal testing justified?": [
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so uh yeah thank everyone for showing up here i am brian i'll be the moderator today so first off we're gonna do a quick audio check if you can introduce yourself just give your name and then say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so whoever wants to jump in first'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm just gonna fat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'my name 's falguni and the audio check the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK there's a little bit of static i'm not sure if you can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's a way you can fix that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would just do the check'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK so my name is rajat sharma and audio check the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK sounds good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hi i'm melinda and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'alright perfect'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you want me to go again or is it better now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's it sounds good go ahead and do it again it just make sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah this is falguni the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK perfect perfect so uh i think you guys have gotten some information about this so the the whole goal in this is to have a lively discussion interruptions or are welcome so don't feel like you have to wait until silence is speak and our topic today is is animal testing justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so starting off is UM is there any way he wants to take the yes on this side the no what do you guys stand with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say i would start with this conversation with the in the current scenario i'll say that i i i'm in a negative sense of it that there are better ways that we can go ahead with the rather than going in the traditional way of experimenting drugs and cosmetics over animals so i'm not in favor i'm against it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so yeah uh on a certain level like if somebody just randomly ask you that do you think animal justice sorry animal testing is justified yeah my answer would definitely be no because you know it it just signifies cruelty over a latter species just because we are better at doing something you know human is it comes under comes a little bit on top of the pyramid so that doesn't mean we can cruel cruel to the other species'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if you go a little deeper and think about the alternatives i think you know then somewhere you will start getting a little dilemma that can we say completely no to this then i think we can't completely you know ignore it and we can't completely scrap that whole process right away because i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah let's see yeah true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah this that's the scientists are giving the their debate is that they say that there is currently no other way to achieve their scientific objectives yeah but you know when we see there is an option but we are neglecting the pain and distress that these drugs and these testing are caused to the animals they actually but if we out this distress this brain outweighs the potential benefit of this research is so yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you know right now with all the augmented reality and the meta words there are many other ways we can check out and we have AI and machine learning as well so hence we can come up with a way to see how these molecules of drugs can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the human cells so that's my yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yes so yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's justified sometimes i mean especially in the case of medication to see how it's going to interact with humans'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i don't think it's always justified i mean cosmetics i don't believe that's justified but you know when it comes to betterment for our human race as far as especially medication goes i think it can be justifiable to test on rats and pigs and stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so you know if it comes to medication so basically you know if you're not testing on them so it it ultimately is like you're testing on humans right so you need to test it somewhere so maybe that's why you know usually as you said rats are chosen because i was doing some reading and they said like rats DNA and human DNA is very close and also if it is some behavioral drug like related to some you know psychology point of view then they usually do the testing on monkeys'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see my yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because behaviorally humans are very you know close to that's kind of species so they have chosen it's not like they want to do it but because they have to test it before the release it the product for a human they are doing it and i absolutely agree with melinda when she said you know the cosmetic stuff need not be done'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's a point like when we are talking about checking those drugs affect on an molecule level on a DNA level so why don't we do that on themselves of the animals and the human cells see that's what my argument is rather than distressing and causing pain to an entire organism why not do it on a molecular level and check the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry it because that's what we are doing in the human sense like and apart from that we when we talk about the behavioral aspect of the testing there's an that's an unethical way in both human and in the animal ways because you know when the morality of the test thing goes out of the picture like the scientists will come up OK now how about we try to test on people who are lacking some you know humanly function or people brain dead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people so i think if we if we will take a stand on that we don't accept testing hash testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no animals then we will say that this is a limit that we are against it on unethical practices on moral practices so that's my argument like if they will diminishing the line'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but if we test it on just molecules or i mean cells and stuff we're not gonna be able to get psychological responses out of the creatures there has to be a whole behavioral aspect to it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see that's that's that's the argument see what i'm trying to say is that's the argument that scientists are giving to us that this we are not able to test the drugs and testing capacity because we won't be able to see how the psychological effects of that drugs are and that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually a tradit what you just said not just the psychological part i would just doing some reading about the exact same thing because whatever you just question no i got the exact same question why can't we do the test at a cellular level or a molecular level so the actual reason is that when they see our bodies or our cells are basically living when we are alive they behave differently and once you die and if you if they do a blood test on your exact blood once you're dead it behaves'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's partially true true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'completely different so you know they have not been able to find an alternative to test on dead cells like the cells which are not exactly living right now so they are actually working on it i've been doing some reading they are they are working a lot because you know there are so many ngos also these days which are opposing this you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but phalguna actually i was also working with some i'm also working with DNA and being in engineer from my grads i have actually learned about some testing that were done to find cancer cell for example there was an AI machine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'turning model but that was built in japan regarding differentiating between brits type of breads because japanese people try would like to purchase bread in not in packaging they like to purchase bread in an open state hence some scientists came up and produced an machine learning that how can on just pieces of looking at a bread they can decide what kind of a bread on the what state of the bread it is so and actually they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the doctors saw that this codes can help them in finding cancerous cells in human as well so i say i'm saying it's not just a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'powered'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know that the technology we are lacking technology it's just being not putting that effort you know because animals don't resist they don't rebel they don't do any kind of an outright upright for this that don't do these kind of in harsh test on us so that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm get it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the voice is yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but our bodies work with multiple systems i mean we have multiple systems so if we're testing on just a certain individual type of cells that's not going to tell us what it's going to do to the whole system'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and it in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's why yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so they are actually working on it i i i agree with what you're saying but you know i i still am not you know still not OK with the idea of this but i say it is essential in some cases there is no other way but these days you know actually i won't say that they are not putting an effort because i think three years ago i haven't heard the concept or maybe five years ago i haven't heard something called'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the positive direction we can't say that they're making an effort but maybe maybe with with times changing and with so many you know these days even people are becoming aware of it previously nobody would have bothered about where this is coming from if it is beneficial for me i'm OK with it i don't care if it is killed a dog or a rat or a pig but now it's not the case right even people are changing they're becoming aware they're becoming they are trying to know about what is this thing coming from what have been done with it previously all those things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's it's all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so with all even the peoples mindset is changing so somewhere it is definitely gonna affect the huge companies or the huge players who are participating in these kind of testing i think we are on the right path it might take us a few years but i think we will get there eventually yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're taking steps in the right direction'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'listen i i guess i i would like to point put a point across that most experiments on animal are not relevant to human health as well so they do not contribute meaningful to medical advances and many are undertaken simply out of curiosity that's what i'm saying they the morality line'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'said he'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you docility and mostly convenience also yeah it's just convenient for them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i don't support that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how would you guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how would you guys uh draw the line or or would it be government you know the government deciding what can be done because it sounds like yes you guys are four if it's gonna help save humans if it's important medical research so where do you draw that line at how is that done'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah actually see that's my point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think the initiative has full obviously come from the government because you know it government is something which can start something right if you start it as a lower level it will be very difficult to take it from the top but if you're starting it at the topmost level it is easy to you know branch it down to the lower so first initiative it would be great if it comes from the government but it can't be controlled at the top level so i think you know these days how we see these there are these small small bodies which are helping small businesses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'say no cosmetics i wouldn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at loans or something so i think at a lower level there has to be some there have to be some bodies that come up which are governing over these laws and these rules also so i firstly start from top but the problem cannot be solved on the top level it has to eventually branch out to the bottom level but it has to start from the top the initiative has to come from the government'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with that i agree with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also also there's an there's an aspect of you see when we talk about humans donating their bodies for experimentation purposes and they they are not used sometimes they are we have seen the news that those bodies were not used for the experimentation or for the health part but we're used in a different aspect and we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'setting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no they sell those bodies to do experiments you know crash tests thing like well i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly exactly so that's what that's yeah that's what my point is so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'she'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or even just for tissue sampling'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and when we get to know we when we got to know about that we protested about that but animals do not willingly sacrifice themselves for the advancement of human welfare you know they don't have any kind of decision making there they are just you know picked up and done a lot of just out of curiosity sometimes i would say out of ten'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those six to seven experiments are just for the curiosity of a young scientist yeah and you know there we have to have a basic moral right to you know respect them as well because you know in future they can say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'conveniency yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'said it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh people who are in the vegetative state they don't have any consent but they this is very much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'needed for our betterment of human mind and you know they can say let's why not why stop in the vegetative human people why not go to the babies as well so there will be a diminishing of morality there so that's what my point is rather than'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah there has to be tight regulations on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know if if we don't draw a line they can keep crossing that line because there is no particular line as of now you know we don't know how far they and also we are just talking about how cruel it is and everything but we are not looking at one part of it that you know we are a part of a big food chain we are part of a pyramid and if we keep depleting one part of the pyramid indirectly it's gonna affect us we are indirectly gonna affect a very essential part of a food chain if we are killing something then what are we gonna eat in the future right so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we are not concentrating on that food chain thing also because it is very important for the balance of the whole thing these days we learn we are you know we keep hearing about climate change and global warming that is because we are you know losing our resources we keep depleting them so even animals is a very important part of ecosystem and not just being cruel to them but by killing them we are indirectly causing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know we are indirectly affecting our own future on this planet actually it's definitely gonna affect us in a very bad way in the long run that is how the effect is getting the big picture also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see i just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just want to put a point across yeah please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think the government should regulate it i think they there should be tight restrictions on how they do it and someone that oversees should be laws'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'basically what is essential and what is not has to be made very clear like if it is something that is coming in terms of medication or vaccines or healthcare then maybe because there is no other way so until we find a way maybe we can justify this until a level but in a lot more things we can't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually i would you know you might have you might have heard about that transparent transparent frog that they came up and said yeah it's to see how the cancer cell builds inside a frog and those dissection of frogs in a classroom was top as well so see i'm saying that it can be stopped there are alternatives to for example now students have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct yeah i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know but there was a body i i i saw that in one of the startups that was shown that a person created a human body'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a you know and then with the form of some silicon tissue which was totally totally in in you know in totally replica of where he really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'replica in love'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of a real human body and they were they were able to test the how the muscle will bruise how the choking effect will look on it so i'm saying there are alternatives right now yeah and plus'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh that's awesome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it yeah we are on the right direction that i definitely agree there are so many advances i think the technology is growing so quick that the last i i would say the last two years of advance you know advancement is equal to the ten years before you know what we have done in the past maybe ten years was done in the last two years more than that was done in the last two years so we are exponentially growing in that way and looking at that i think that we are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i am hopeful that this will all stop very soon but as we you know spoke later and as melinda said there has to be some regulatory body because some you know they have to start it from a point if everybody's just talking about it and nobody 's doing anything then this will not come for a hall so you know there has to be some kind of regulation at least if not completely stop it they can at least at least you know differentiate between what can be justified what is absolutely essential and what can be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'skipped for now at least what kind of test can we skipped'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i i think that if it's important to save human lives then it is probably essential at this point since we don't have the technology to do it another way but if it's something just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'plus plus this entire'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know non consequential cosmetics lotions you know things like that then yeah there should be regulations and there should be strict regulations and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and plus are you know i'll stand should not just because we feel for humans we for feel for this animal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because obviously you know if they will talk about testing on our dogs or cats which are very close to us we will obviously go against that but i'm saying it's not just out of feeling for these animals it's sense stanford an ethical practice'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know for example i i give you i will give you an example that they are testing which were done in nineteen forties and early early nineties those testings were not at all considering the human life like for example nuclear testing would and scientists were thinking of doing testing without there wasn't there was a threat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'finish morality and are you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that entire globe could have cached fire because nuclear nuclear energy generation could have reacted with oxygen of our earth but nobody stopped on it because everyone was very curious about to do that and the curiosity leads to a lot of havocs so i'm just saying rather than the feeling part we think more critically if we think about animal testing more critically we'll get the answer that this is wrong this is wrong because you know there was testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we have a we had a very big example of covid in front of us there you know testing testing these diseases over the animal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you know those i mean these it's not just about their pain and suffering when you there is an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'call it is an aspect of you know moving disease from animal to human so if you know when you're getting into these kind of things which you know don't know so you are playing'",

        "'speaker_1': 'piaya'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct any miss happen happened right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely absolutely that's what i'm saying that it's not just the feeling part it's a critical analysis part of that as well that it could lead to more danger as well we don't know that right now so it should be it should be curbed that's my point here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hit it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'even that is missing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know so that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely absolutely yeah and you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm sure money is a factor in that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes i absolutely because companies don't think about the sustainable sustainability out of how the phase management can be done and that's a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'setting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know intrinsic intrinsic problem of the entire industry structure so i totally agree with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think i think the financial aspects actually a pretty big thing i was gonna throw that in there for you guys to talk about because obviously you know testing on rats monkeys is gonna be a lot cheaper than trying to you know fall is more regulations if you get human testing you'll have to pay humans they're the volunteer so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it sounds like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah that's that's totally true you know you're not paying paying at least for fifty bucks to a human for a simple testing and paying zero buck to a rat it always is economically better to do that yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so so you know once once we if we want to put in more regulations i mean obviously first you need to talk to the scientists that are doing these but a lot of them are gonna argue hey we need this animal testing are they doing it because they really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do need it or is because there's a financial yeah cause with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're just being lazy i think yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it depends on what sector it's in you know if it's if it's in the beauty section in the beauty sector of course they you know it's not needed but if it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know psychotropic medications or anything like that it probably is needed i think money is probably a driving factor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah at least at least like the initial phase of testing yeah we can't avoid avoid at least the initial phase of testing on animals before maybe they can test maybe in the second or third stage on the humans but yeah as melinda said we can't avoid in some situations we just can't avoid the animal testing for some you know some specific things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and i think for the the for the vaccine process i think they've gotten that pretty regulated so yes there will be animal testing first and then there'll be the basically the human round i know kind of falling out with covid i know somebody who had volunteered to be one of the first testers i mean they got paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'plus plus this plus this also one more thing that i have seen going through my MBA right now that when these companies these scientists'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no you know open up that they were testing these products on animals people reject that product in the in the current scenario hence and they find the thin companies open up their mind and try to find ways that which are not exploiting animals so i'm saying it's more about the transparency part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if companies start saying that yeah and people let's say a product a company says we have this product and we are testing this on animals for your saft people will reject that product and they say we don't need you we'll go to your competition and when there's an environment of computation other company will use this as an their USB that we don't test our product on animals people will do move to that product that company i've seen that like for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah these days'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's that's the hope'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like for example this is this is happening in the these green products for example natural products so people were saying that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a mascara a cosmetic product was you know tested on rabbit eyes and which was you know burning their cornea and other company was providing this mascara this cosmetic product which was totally herbal they were not testing on and though the price of that product the herbal was much higher than the previous product people were moving towards that product so i think the transparency part was will play a very crucial part in that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i agree and also you know the thing that actually related like what you just said see the reason they they feel the need to test it is it has some chemicals right so the you know the the best thing to avoid is avoid unnecessary chemicals if if you can make a product without using chemicals you just do it and you don't have to test it right because if it's not chemical composition it won't harm the human skin or something so you know it all comes down to the same thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i have seen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'essential and you know just convenience so we need to you know people need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know kind of bike or these kind of products and maybe they'll make an effort yeah it has to come from the people some part of it definitely has to come from the society yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's more of yeah because people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because people if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if that product is harming at an animal why won't that product harm me as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yes so the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that theory argument is yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so you know if there are no chemicals in your product you wouldn't need you wouldn't have to test it on an animal just to make sure so especially in the cosmetic fields'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's cheaper for them to use the chemicals though is why they do that i think it's it's greed and it's it's making money as what it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes absolutely you don't you don't yeah you don't test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exact'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm exactly they're checking that if we can manufacture this product in a lower cost but people are like i'm talking about the current current scenario like right now in the market if the product is if the product is more expensive but it's not tested on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the animal is not having any chemicals people will go for that product and you know this argument of the companies that we have to test this product because of this chemical goes out of the picture we don't need that chemical we need a product which is out to be natural and that's the selling point so that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my point is like companies when become more transparent about what's happening behind the wheel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh it it's these all those extra you know exploitation of animals testing on animals goes out of the picture because you know see like testing of vaccination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is something which which is i think everyone would agree that obviously a vaccine that you know help us protect from any kind of a disease need to be safe and still people are OK with testing that on a human part of it on a very very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh you know very low dose and seeing the reaction over it people were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK with that so seeing more so you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly because it was necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and it was very transparent as well people knew what is happening behind the picture so that's you know this will pick up companies being more honest and being more honest and transparent will help and us in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hit it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'eradicating this animal quality of testing drugs and cosmetic over'",
        "'speaker_2': 'human testing can go very wrong sometimes though i don't know if you guys are familiar with the tuskegee experiments i believe it was in alabama here in the US but for at least a generation it might have been a few generations they were testing syphilis on african american mostly men'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah yeah yeah i've i've gotten there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and yeah it just ruins their you know it ruined their lives it ruined their families lives it ruin it for generations yeah so human testing can go wrong'",
        "'speaker_4': 'generations yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that and that was a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that was definitely one because you know they started testing you know so i forget what they're testing on syphilis but then like six months if they started penicillin was like oh this will help cure it and they just kept testing for like fifteen years and yeah these four four people they took advantage of them so i know that's that's just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they kept it from them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes human testing can go wrong they could have that that could have been rats you know it could have been a different type of animal other than human and it wouldn't have affected lives whole lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'get it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and see that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that was something i think maybe with a look at two overall the once you get the the funding for certain things because they had funding for that research and they didn't want to say hey we don't need this money we don't need this to do this anymore they're just like OK this money was set for ten fifteen years i'm gonna keep taking these paychecks and keep testing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and yeah greed is such a driving factor in a lot of things especially with the animal testing you know with the beauty products and everything i do agree that there are times when it is needed as far as medications go studying biology certain certain biology aspects but money is such a driving factor and there are animals suffering for no reason we don't have to have mascara we don't have to have blush'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sex'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and i i saw a number i want to throw it out there and see what you guys thought this is just from the US they said in in one year there were three hundred thousand animals that were tested on that involved pain so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'three hundred thousand involving pain in one year that seems that seems really high'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that seems excessive i wonder what they were specifically trying to test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually i got to know about some there's a you know i i will just share a a news also that in some eastern part many you know the vendors were selling fishes and some birds which were tested in labs and when they when they died they just washed them out and they were selling on the street so you know it's just it's really really hard'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there has been a new'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i think the thing that the the the animals which were tested on for different chemicals we don't know they those were ready to be consumed by public because people didn't knew that so yeah that's also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that just brings us back around to greed right there it's all money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'too late yes and also like something about what brian just said about the how many you know the number that you just gave so there recently'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there has been this new thing that they are applying i don't know how recent this is but at least i found out about it recently so there have been testing on animals and before they perform the test if it is something that could induce pain they are you know they are just doing something you know maybe removing the brain pain receptors or something and you know they are testing just to avoid giving them the pain and now i don't know how good it is because can it be undone or not that i'm not aware of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i definitely read about this new process that in some animals maybe i think dogs or monkeys they are doing some testings and before they do conduct that test they are you know kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh it taking off their pain receptors just doing something to at least so that it doesn't cause some pain so i thought OK it's not like completely it just by doing that you can't say that OK now testing is fine because it's not in pain no it's not but i thought it's a good thing that at least they are thinking about it you know if it is completely unavoidable then maybe be a little bit less cruel about it so i thought that was something good yeah that was some i just found a little hope that maybe if they thought'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because if they came up with this idea then they must be thinking in a good way right they must be thinking key OK let's do it with as much less as less pain as possible so maybe in future if they can come this far maybe they can you know come up with a way to cause no pain at all and do it in a morally ethical way also so that was i felt a little bit hopeful after finding out about it that at least they are trying to do it without causing any pain to the animals but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'plus adding up to you i saw that in the coward error as well so there's a part i was you know following this you know vaccine however they were trying to come up with the solution to for a vaccine for this for this yeah so they what they did was they did they were trying to do it with a synthetic copy of the virus genetic code where you might have seen through the news so instead of instead of the weekend form of the virus so i saw that if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct even i found out about it during the covid time recently'",

        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're thinking on those line it's like fantastic by people 's people scientists were trying to vaccine very fast but still they didn't you know compromise on you know going ahead and testing that on an animal because there was speculation that this virus might have come from any animal testing only so that's what that's you know if they put up all those scientists across the group put their mind on this that we'll use the synthetic copy of the various genetic code rather than'",

        "'speaker_4': 'you know testing them on a real animal so and they found a way so you know if for other diseases like many of the testings are basically done on the on animals based on their lever on the cancer part and if everyone put their mind across you know put their mind together to find a solution for that it could you know result to better solution so yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
