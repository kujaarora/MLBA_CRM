        "'speaker_2': 'any general like uh concerns with that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we want to start with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i definitely do'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah kind of speaking on like the same point i think uh so with with a lot of the jobs in the government for example like some job to the police or things like that i think they have a very thorough background check and they definitely see a social media and they really best to you for it so for example like for them like if you go on to jobs like this the wedding procedures are so tough like they will paint you as a criminal for just having whatsapp for god 's sake so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm i mean i i understand their point that they wanna look at it just just to make sure that that you know they know what they're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into the know that the employee that that's coming into the team but i think to the point that it's invasive would be like maybe looking into chats looking into like pictures think of that i mean what you put out there on instagram facebook fair enough OK have a look for like police jobs and things make sense but like when it comes to chats and things like that i think that's that's just insane honestly how could they do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well no i don't think they should because that is no posts anybody can see the post if they're public and stuff'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm it's it's all it's it's a discrete it's a discretion to the the user and i don't know i i'm on the fence because it is a public profile so it's it's there for everyone to see so i think it's important to be conscious of what you're what you're posting and and being aware that you are being perceived you know there are users and there are people that are are other users that are watching so yeah i i think that it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it it is a little bit could be a little bit on the side of invasion of privacy but also i could see how it could be fair as an employer to kind of wanna see what you're what you're being represented as because when and you when you become a part of a company you kind of are representing the company a little bit so you sort of become the face of that so i don't know i'm a little i'm a little on the defensive about it but'",

        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah i would definitely say that messages should definitely be private and that should be off limits on posts are probably i'd say OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah no i think like companies these days it is stretching it to be fair so like employees and companies existed really well even before social media existed and i understand like a huge part of our world right now is in social media and things like that like it's it's just like us part two or like that's that's that's another life altogether but like if you if you look back like fifty years ago nobody made a check on like your friends when social media didn't exist nobody made a check on your family your friends'",

        "'speaker_4': 'you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know business side of things might be like linkedin i can understand somebody should be able to view all your stuff on that because while that's four jobs and or i mean i say all maybe not chats i don't mean like that but like you know in general that's all job based or should generally be job and training so that i can understand if they put you know stricter limits on and stuff like to like ohh we should be able to look at these because well'",

        "'speaker_1': 'public'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't think employers should even care about anything you say online like if as long as you're a nice person like face to face and you do your job like why should they care'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah and i meant mainly on linkedin and stuff is'",

        "'speaker_1': 'basically like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'also i don't think you should be held account like the way that social like the social justice like movement is going in this country it's like if you do one wrong thing on social media they'll use whatever that post that comment that you made or even if it's a comment on someone else 's post they'll take that screenshot it and then send it to all of your future employers like'",

        "'speaker_1': 'completely like banned from all future employment just because you made one stupid decision like posting something i don't think that like as long as it doesn't like hurt someone as long as it's like not a photo like a sexually graphic photo or like image or something that could tarnish like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'your company 's reputation i don't think that you should really like i don't think that one thing should hinder you from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like their personality'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all future job prospects you know i don't think that's fair'",

        "'speaker_2': 'that's carried away that's really carried away'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but then i mean i get your point but then my contract argument that would be what is the guarantee so i'm not saying for for like minor things like you know like i don't like this company or that company or whatever but like just just saying outright like racist things for example or or things against like a certain political party or things like that now if if that party comes out later in the news to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know involved in some scandal or whatever that can't be held against you i get that because when you supported them they weren't involved in scandal or whatever but then what if you say something that's outright race is'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i completely disagree with that sorry i don't buy that cause'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean it's a small tiny piece yes but that doesn't really equate to who you are you're not just a racist if you support republicans like that doesn't make you a racist at all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or that doesn't make you a cocoon if you're black like like some people call me akoon because i liked some of the things that donald trump'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know actually enacted through his presidency so like'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well if they're gonna put that against you i mean what does that make like the middle of the road party then that could be a you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not knowing exactly which way what does that what does that say about those people then you know that i kind of get what you're saying they shouldn't just judge like cause even if you may not like a person overall'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they could make some things that are you know some of the coolest decisions that you've seen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i can get that i can get you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because i mean i i do agree with some of the stuff he says but not all of it like i know deep down inside he does have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'some racist like ideals but i don't dive into that part of whatever his thought process is like i look for more of the stuff that actually helps like that actually uplifts like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'he you know like boosted the economy like it was some crazy amount like almost like over five percent growth with like for GDP and like yeah so like he's done good things but like the media just wants to castrate and demonize him automatically so like anyone that has like a free mind there's a free thinker and says ohh some of the things he's saying you know might actually be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'worth analyzing and we're thinking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know like we're in the age right now where the information age that social justice warrior age where like if you just say one thing that people don't like then you're gonna be demonized for it so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i think it just to like um becomes like a risk factor thing like as a company and as a company you come with like a company culture and a lot of times people do like display themselves and their personality and their different traits and their humor and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on social media so i think it is fair that companies can review that stuff and they get to decide if they feel like you are somebody that could be a part of the company culture or not based off of those those the ways that you interact because a lot of times that's what it comes down to and a company is how well can somebody like integrate and how well can they get along with like the company culture so i think i could see how it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they could be fair'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like if if the people are serious you mean like maybe uh serious about the job like if they're ones that are never you talking about maybe if i you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people see like oh that person 's never serious which could be the person on social media but they could be serious in life just fine you know but there's some things that make it look like you're just like one of the people that doesn't care about life even if you could be the best at some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know jobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i mean like it it basically it's to me it's like it's it's like an an an an impediment on your future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the way that the social media and the and like CNN and all of those liberal like like i'm not taking a stance i do support ideals from both the liberals and conservatives but like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but it's basically the liberals right now that are trying to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'control the narrative online'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like they deem whatever is you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'acceptable socially acceptable or not socially acceptable and this one streamer for example called gideon he has millions of followers on tik tok millions of tens or he's about to hit ten million on youtube or if he hasn't already'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so he was his first twitch stream like literally his first one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm like justin as as an example he'",
        "'speaker_1': 'he basically there's this other streamer named pok\u00e9mon who's a girl this half asian half white girl who's also a streamer on twitch he basically called her out for being a racist'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of because she said the N word on one of her streams'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then he was demonized and eventually twitch banned him because they said that he was trying to incite violence against her'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that it broke their guidelines that what he did on his live stream but i don't think that should have been grounds for him to lose all of that money that he could have potentially made from twitch cause he lost millions off of sponsorships endorsements same shit happens so sorry for being explicit the same thing happened to tiger woods'",
        "'speaker_1': 'same thing happened to um'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like michael jordan when they found out that he was secretly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like fund or an investor in the private prison system of yeah so like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'literally for like the dumbest things you can like lose your livelihood like and i don't think that's fair'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i get you but then honestly what what is the need or the point of posting these things like i get it it's like a temporary dopamine here it's a temporary serotonin head all of that yeah people praise you you you meet similar people all of that but then why not just keep it limited to your immediate circle like why do you necessarily need to post it online where everyone can see it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's free speech this is america we should be allowed to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'freedom of speech'",
        "'speaker_1': 'period it's in the constitution'",

        "'speaker_1': 'but i mean it's america this is it's a free country'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for a used to be i don't think it is anymore but'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i can definitely see both sides'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that's what makes it difficult'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because like you could literally save one stupid thing like post one stupid like not even like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it doesn't even have to be racial honestly it could just be like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't even like i don't even wanna use the example but let's just say like i'll i'll make up an example let's just say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you you've been hired to this company right it's a similar company to appen you get hired as an independent contractor and then you start working and let's just say it's like facebook or google and you get hired to one of those big firms'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so you start working for them and it's a work from home jobs so you necessarily don't have to go outside'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all of that time you're inside the house and cooped up for seven eight hours working you're eventually gonna get bored honestly so like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what are you gonna do then you're gonna call your friends you're gonna watch TV you're gonna go on social media and then what's gonna happen when you go on social media you're gonna see all of the posts that you follow in like which by the way is kind of messed up because facebook personalizes it for you so all of the stuff that you already have in your head is already the stuff that you're gonna see anyway on your feet on your newsfeed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i think that'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so if you're at home like the whole day and you're it's like a stay it's a work from home job like facebook or if you get health hired from google or appen or something like some job that's online based'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're eventually gonna get bored at home'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then you're gonna see something stupid on your news feed from like some ridiculous thing and then let's say you react to it let's just say you put a comment right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then someone sees it one of your friends sees it and then uses it to manipulate like these take screenshots of it and then send it to your employer like and cause they wanna get you fired like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how how fair is that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's just somebody trying to ruin your reputation and i can see that you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's not good if it happens of course but it's like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because then you really have no control like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'great i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i wish they would just not if they're gonna look at the stuff like i don't know i wish it would they just weren't like completely serious about it if it you know isn't generally gonna mess up the company'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe there should be like a level of lenience like a bar of a lenience that they can they can implement and follow if if it is if they are gonna be you know breaching privacy for their employees'",
