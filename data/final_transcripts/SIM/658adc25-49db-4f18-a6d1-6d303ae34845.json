        "'speaker_1': 'but they can check on that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well especially if you're replying it depends on the job you're applying for too if you're applying for a job that requires you to be on social media for the company will sure yeah invite them to look at your i would in fact i would have happily invite them but if i'm there just to do data entry for example'",

        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh things to feel and be promoting online to many followers about working in a hospital you wouldn't trust that doctor like he like so he went against that hospital 's policy with what he was like and then was shocked when he was let go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah if it's right it's they're right up front and hospitals are right up front about that policy too i believe they tell you they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right it exactly it was not underhanded he he knew'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not a surprise'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah if you work for like apple computer and and get online and start ripping on apple computers then you should expect i mean it's like i said there i i just think there's a balance of i think it's gonna be done regardless to i even and if they wanna find a reason to fire you like that one guy who's who did that stuff they could find a reason to fire you cardless so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but well they should they be allowed to do that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so don't you think there is a contradiction here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that by the kind of allowing companies to search and and check on everything and then hide in it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'by by you know using a different name and kind of fake personality for the social media'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't think that's so much of a country i don't think that's a contradiction i think that's just people people like to have their personal space and people that's just that's a humanity thing i don't think that's so much even like a work thing it's like we all like certain things be personal and we like certain things to be on the outside we it's just and we we allow our certain bit of like intrusiveness with with certain people and not with others so'",

        "'speaker_2': 'me neither'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean what we allow on facebook and what we allow in say instagram or any anything where we're presenting ourselves to the web i mean that i don't think that it makes anything contradictory to in order if you want to create one work persona and another persona that is just has nothing to do with work i don't i don't find that i don't think that's a contradiction i think that's just the way of separating the two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah plus i have different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but do do you think companies for example should be able to ask for your real profile on facebook like they you know you're applying to some company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they could ask for whatever they want'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not everybody has a facebook'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but i mean i'm just saying they can ask whatever they want it or not it for choir it is a different that's a different question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true and they it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sorry'",

        "'speaker_2': 'wanted social media handles that actually match their real name i want that's still hinky but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that would make more sense and just giving them everything you know carte blanche which you know nobody 's gonna nobody's gonna do that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'filter'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yeah that's it it's crazy you need to have your personal space'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it also needs to be clearly spelled out i wouldn't agree to that unless it was spelled out in writing and checked by lawyers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i've just because i've seen people fired over the stupidest things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they'll they'll they complained about this person that they worked for ten years ago and your point would be what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they complained about incompetence'",

        "'speaker_4': 'that's understandable too but thing is i think you can't just throw a blanket over everything and like in certain instances like there would be statements that if somebody said ten years ago i'm going to like do something drastic i don't wanna gonna this is what the but i'm gonna do something very drastic and against the law and then OK so ten years later you may wanna take that into consideration i mean so that that's why you can't just throw a blanket'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah something like that yeah'",
