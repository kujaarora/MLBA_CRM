        "'speaker_1': 'according now just a moment here you're being recorded and transcribed so let me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'start here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so let's get'",
        "'speaker_1': 'jennifer if you could say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thanks rich'",

        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all right so here's a go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we have a good going slow is uh should standardized testing be abolished i'm gonna say yeah and does anyone want to we'll set up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anyone against uh anyone with my position here should be abolished'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'd like to take that position if possible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK jennifer and so let's start with you jennifer uh what is a good some good good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i actually worked in a school setting a public school setting and have experienced this first hand and i particularly find the high stakes testing to be cruel a lot of students don't test well and it's a lot of pressure on young people it also testing itself eats into a large portion of the school year the school i was at it was a month long process where it would impact the time that students could have been receiving instruction'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah sort of teaching to the test rather than teaching'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i think it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and not even teaching because the students were testing or making up tests or holding off because some students had missed so they didn't want to move forward so yes i yes definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i don't know that i think the scores really have many useful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'predictors of future success or teachers abilities or how well students perform other than how well they test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so you've had first hand experience it's it's stress it's pretty stressful on those what are those like the taxes do they still do the tax'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it depends on the state the state i'm in it's a leap testing but they have different acronyms could depending on what state you're in but yeah it's all essentially the same yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so one on one hand it's it's pretty stressful and it doesn't necessarily it takes a lot of time out from other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'parts of education that are important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes and i think it's more of an indicator of you know how well students test some students just simply don't test well they have the knowledge they have the ability it's this you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'does does it affect the student though'",
        "'speaker_2': 'high stakes does if it's a high stakes that means they won't promote to the next grade level so i was at a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK see that's what i was yeah i didn't know that because i always thought that standardized testing was basically just meant to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'basically test the school and and maybe the curriculum not like not the actual individual taking the test'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and it's only like the state i'm in high stakes was it's they no longer have it but it was only fourth and eighth grade everyone tested but the high stakes you know whether or not you would move forward or promote was only fourth and eighth graders if that makes sense'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK no i understand that yeah i just i just wasn't completely sure exactly what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'standardized testing i didn't even realize that that was like even the thing like talking about you know getting rid of it i mean i i i don't really it's hard for me to take a position because i don't really understand the whole concept of it in the first place because like i said as i thought it was more or less to test the school and not the not the student'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rich did you take standardized testing when you were in school do you remember'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do you remember getting your scores was that something i i was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i definitely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no that's the that's i i mean it's possible i did but i don't remember getting my scores at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ditto yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm actually a unique'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i mean i'm i'm i'm old i mean i'm like i'm i just turned fifty fifty two so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean that we're talking many many years ago so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm only a twenty three so i've actually had some pretty pretty recent experience with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some sort of i guess what you talking about high stakes standardized testing i think i guess i'll take the opposite position here to you jennifer and say that in my experience it actually helped prepare me for future tests down the road especially in like a university setting because that's sort of up to universities and i don't think that's going anywhere anytime soon so i look at sort of the younger generations as maybe being a bit ill prepared for what the next step of education might have for them and then even beyond that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in terms of looking for you know jobs in a career i think that you know many professions require some sort of high stakes standardized tests and i think that it's it's actually not a terrible thing to be sort of prepped in that way and have that experience under your belt of being in a high stakes situation and having to perform because as i move on and i'm starting a career now it's that's definitely something that i'm comfortable with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i know that when i look to you know younger people who i know who didn't have the same requirements purely based on covid or whatever may have been in the way to sort of abolish these standardized tests i feel like they might be at a slight disadvantage to me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'garrett do you think your SAT or ACT or both scores helped you get into college'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i do but i i think that my SAT scores are actually quite marginal in that decision to be honest but i think just in terms of a life experience that helped me be comfortable taking exams in in university and and knowing that this is you know going to be important to my final grade going to be important to my future and just sort of help contextualize everything in that way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah no i understand that probably to understand having to perform under time restraints or stressful situations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just taking skills and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess college application scores those are good things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those are very good things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what about for students who maybe aren't college bound'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what is the test measure because i study'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a couple of different things but uh we look at validity of the exam is it measuring what it's supposed to measure stuff like that but what is the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rich had a confusion that it was to test the school and i thought at some point like the no child left behind i did think that that was sort of inactive recently and i don't know if it's been abolished but that one is was sort of to test the teachers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes all of the above it test it tests the the individual students the teachers efficacy a lot of their you know like bonuses or pay scale is based on their students test scores and then they're looked at as a whole for the school their school gets a letter grade the schools letter grade includes things other than test score but that is a a large portion of it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'competence'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i remember all that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what can i ask you umm do you think that that is go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah see that that was my whole thing is i thought i didn't even i thought the students were just random like i didn't even think their names came up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no they definitely come up yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that was that was my that was my understanding my limited understanding apparently'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no understandable it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you think that it tests what it's supposed to test'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's probably a good question for garrett'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean in my experience i've had i've had both i've had you know where where some tests were first being introduced and you know during my you know my class year and those were terrible in some regards like they they were not that we were told that they weren't gonna be counted and that this was a trial run which is a a very silly thing to tell a bunch of teenagers but you i think that like you know something like the SAT or the ACT'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm while i do find it a bit outdated in terms of measuring you know intelligence for all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this college readiness more so right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah yeah uh but i i do find those to be a much more representative of of someone 's you know intelligence but they obviously don't apply to the school districts or the teachers in the same way that i feel like is a much more'",
        "'speaker_4': 'individualized you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah the yeah i believe that too the SAT is much more about how you go about learning and how'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how much you're gonna put forth'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's like a pre qualification almost for some stuff but intelligence test is different than is a standardized well they can both be standardized but i think intelligence test testing is different than like an SAT or a leap or something like that that's i also think those kinds of constructs some of these are built from like you know things that aren't even real intelligence testing and all those things those are constructs that are not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you mean like IQ test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'valid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like yeah like an IQ test uh those are kinds of things that i study in my profession those are you know not necessarily useful they're called they're part of colonization as well it's not something that is really great'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i was just talking about like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but as we're talking about college bound things then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't i don't i have yeah i don't i don't really care much about IQ test i was just saying i didn't like consider the SAT to be anything like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'standardized testing i think they're kind of in two different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'circles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's like a a pre thing like are you gonna go to college is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is that is that what that is OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yeah college bound students would be taking those tests standardized tests every student would be taking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i've also i don't know garrett i haven't i haven't tested in many many years and i haven't seen the testing that stuff kept under lock and key i in my position at the school i didn't see the actual test but i have heard'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that part i do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'criticism that they're racist and classist some of the questions are phrased'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's interesting yeah i i think as far as where i grew up in and where where i was taking these tests i feel like that mostly wasn't an issue'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these days but i definitely have have heard of that being the case UM in other other places other school districts around the country and i mean around the world too i mean if you look historically i think that's that's definitely an aspect of standardized testing that's been weaponized in some in some ways but i don't know i think i think overall you know there there is some room for standardized testing i think maybe sort of what rich pointed out is you know analyzing school districts specifically and how well they're doing or individual schools or maybe even'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'individual departments within schools i think there's some room there for that to be used as an analytical marker for you know the teachers and the school district at large but maybe not so much as you know on the students i don't know how representative standardized tests are of of students ability classroom'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true capabilities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'let's see that's what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and i guess i think too when you said about you know don't tell students it doesn't count so you know you want students to perform their best but then you also don't want that burden to be on you know very up and very young children 's shoulders you know we're talking eight year olds or doing standardized testing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah absolutely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see that's the whole like there's that there's a dichotomy for me because i'm i'm it's kind of garrett brought this up i'm kind of for them if they're gonna test the curriculum or school or or even a district but when it comes down to testing individual students'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't really like it so much because i think that it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it could be classed and it could be racist and it could be it could be worded in a way that is easier for others to some to understand than others so i'm kind of like i'm on the fence in that if they're gonna use it to test the curriculum then i'm cool with it if they're gonna if they're gonna hold back students because of it and and use that against them in any way or form then i'm against that so that's where i'm at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if that makes sense'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i agree i also think that testing students at at that young of an age is is kind of ridiculous like i'm sort of when i'm thinking about this whole standardized testing process and all that i'm more thinking of my experience like in high school as like an older teenager because those were tests that i took most recently and those were the ones that i remember'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah those are the ones i remember and we're talking thirty years ago so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't i don't like you i don't remember'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i don't i don't i mean i don't remember what taking a test was like fifteen years ago for me either so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i watched my kids go through it and they are fortunate that they test well but i remember it being a very large part of her week at that point in time it was a week and you know get to bed early no extra curriculars there were T shirts that they had to wear they'd have pep rallies it was a big lead up which put a lot of unspoken support but also i think pressure on elementary age students'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that seems to me that seems crazy to me i don't i don't get that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was doesn't that just a few years ago where it was just all about the test and testing is that still going on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my my oldest is twenty three like garrett i have a nineteen year old and a twenty three year old and so that was my experience as a parent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stressful time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do think it is good to check in on students progress again you know just recalling working in a a junior high and there were students that clearly were struggling to maintain grade level they've just been you know promoted they they age progress them when they you know hit a certain age like at the junior high once kids hit sixteen they promoted them to the high school regardless because you really don't need you know it's not it's not fair for anyone to have them but they you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'did not have the academic abilities as their fellow high schooler so i do think it is to check good to check in on students progress so kids aren't left behind'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i think maybe that's something that individuals teachers could do and those might also be students who don't test well and you know they have the knowledge and the ability but they don't test well or maybe they're not college bound and academics are not their strong suit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well my idea of the testing schedule there is U M you do i went to some specialized schools for science and stuff like that so my i do have a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let me see who do i know my brother and sister during their testing time it was much different than my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'testing there was like i don't even know what they learned in school all year but they were being taught towards the test so why couldn't you know a programmably implemented or part of the curriculum just regular test taking skills rather than this weird like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i remember in my testing days it was a whole day of sitting in a room'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh being forced to fill out bubbles and stuff like that and then it's boring it's not you know and here's the other thing if you're told that hey this group of kids succeeds at this test and this group of kids doesn't succeed at this test there's that bias that will affect testing you know what i mean so it's like it it's it's it's a difficult thing because many college students probably didn't do that great on any standardized test that's one thing people the times have changed information is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'greater great is is better available now since we have you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'everyone has a computer and stuff like that but why couldn't we start a curriculum instead like test taking skills or something like that rather than like we're not gonna teach you anything we're gonna just tell you that every month or whatever gonna have a month of testing i don't think that that's what i remember that time time was like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think there's actually books i there are books for that i don't think there's a there might be even classes for it but not as part of any like any kind of school or anything but i i do know for a fact they're definitely our books for that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think local libraries'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i remember reading'",
        "'speaker_1': 'test taking skills i know but i mean is is my little sister gonna go i'm gonna go i would have done this in my uh curriculum or my downtime but i don't think my little sister brother is going to go to the library to look up test taking skills necessarily'",
        "'speaker_2': 'local local libraries have programs you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh no it's like a class'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no they probably won't i'm just saying that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no i agree yeah but it's i think they have classes like ACT prep and things like that at the library but that's extracurricular'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah there there is definitely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think there's actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but what kind of test yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm sorry you can go on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no go ahead you're supposed to talk'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i was just gonna say is i i think that there might be even classes for the SAT and the and the ACT also so that's all i was gonna say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a class on top of a class when you're a little kid or like a teenager ohh man that sounds like another thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it wasn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i remember i remember a lot of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well actually i read up a lot before i took the SAT like there's those big big books you know i went through the whole thing so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'though in my experience those have been typically yeah sort of extracurricular things but i i remember a lot of testing skills sort of in classes that we're going to be tested a lot or in a subject that was gonna be tested a lot i remember testing skills being something that was worked on within that class granted maybe not to the extent that you might need especially for some groups of students so there could be there could be some room for students who are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm you know if you're going to implement a very standardized and sort of heavy test load on the students there's definitely some room in my opinion to focus on those test taking skills and and maybe in a class of its own or just in like having a prep class be part of the the daily schedule for for students who need it or those who want it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah all i know is that i felt like i was being tortured during those time periods'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i was thinking about uh probably some kind of sci-fi novel or something else anything else and then i was like what is this that i'm seeing uh who who writes the test test standardized test we all have those measurability all these things but some of it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm you know the history of them the whole logic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cables and all these things i'm not even sure if those were on there then but thinking skills can be taught and then maybe measured but are we teaching students to think in in in these ways pattern recognition stuff like that because i remember when i first saw these patterns and stuff a long time ago i was like i have no idea and you can't really expect someone to learn that necessarily'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think now i do now i see what the what the patterns are but i think that and you know it's standardized it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know it it's a long history of these types of tests and assessments but we just really wanna know like we see garrett has some great results from it rich doesn't recall jennifer sees it in application'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i don't know i would still say probably maybe a different way a method of teaching is a a better idea but i agree with rich and that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we should be measuring the school's competency and what's going on teaching wise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i do think also i live in an area where there's a lot of military families so we have students coming in from other parts of the country and i do think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what is i forget the term now but where they're trying to have national standards so a student moving in say in third grade are getting more or less the same level of instruction that they would have in another state so it's there's not those variabilities where you have families moving into areas and they're either way far ahead or they're way far behind and again even being on the a level playing field going into college if that's the path you know a child is chosen so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do see there being a place for some standardization'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree and i've had i've had a lot of friends i myself haven't moved around but i've had a lot of friends who have moved from out of state or even in state and said that their experience from grade to grade was massively different just just from county to county just you know based on what whatever it may be socioeconomic factors or or just different sort of curriculums but yeah i agree that sort of standardized tests can give students a chance to you know sort of prove that they have this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_4': 'level of of of mastery over something and and also you know have everybody be on a level playing field to where they're not you know there's not any huge gaps in education and and i've seen that happen first hand where where somebody moves in and they they just simply their curriculum taught geometry before algebra or whatever it may be and now they're in in a class where they have are not prepared to to to take this in the way that the other students who have been in the county in the curriculum for the past however many years'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know they have that upper hand on that student so there are some some advantages to to sort of leveling the playing field in that way across states or or across the country'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree i remember when i moved no when i moved from from new york to florida'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's interesting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now this is what i was young very young but i don't remember what they were teaching me in like when i got to florida they were teaching me stuff that i had learned two years prior in new york like that's how far behind they were and i was like this is ridiculous and i mean seriously like it was kind of like rehab i had to basically rehab because i'm talking like this is like fourth or fifth grade so they didn't really have like AP classes or many advanced classes at that point so i basically just kind of had a rehash things that i had already learned and it was ridiculous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i was bored i mean i'd literally just kind of sit in the class like you know drawing pictures and whatnot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right of course you would be yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that sounds like me i'm i still got my degree uh and i'm just moving forward but most of my education was either through music now this i did go into those a specialized school for engineering and science but really i was in the library a lot so that's kind of it does help a lot of critical thinking skills reading a lot to drawing a lot but it's interesting because i see the history here of standardized testing was for in china so that was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sort of uh to see what you could do for the emperor so it's seems to have started back then so if you think if you think about that it is still that's why it's the standardized test like what can you do for this company or these people and you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'll i'll admit i'm learning more about like different cultures and everything through reading and stuff like how chinese script became more universalized later all these things they can't really help you to see why these institutions are in place i mean if that was a long time ago in the dynasty in china it was really just for the emperor what what you could do for for them so i mean it's a test of something it's a measure of something'",

        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you said that it was different between states when you went to school so a benchmarking thing maybe like uh is this student able to do this this that and this elon musk has a good model of learning though i think he's he what what regardless of what you think about how he is and his private personal or life or what he does with his money he sort of is a good thing because he teaches people that everyone can learn everyone has more or less a chance it's not just for only certain people and you can learn a lot of'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yes yeah and i think that educators need to be more involved in the the process of change and improving and not politicians i think it's a lot different when you're not in that setting to really understand the realities i think a lot of politicians are well intended but they just like the reason the testing the standardized testing took a month was it was all on the computer online but the school only had so many computers so would take a month'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just to get everyone tested so the intent was at a month of testing that's just the reality'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know changing the way that legislation and educators approach teaching and learning as a whole because that's that's a huge shift and and almost in some ways can kind of take away from any sort of test taking skills that you may have learned being sat in a room because a lot of that is going away a lot of that isn't that being being the standard anymore even at the even at the highest level and even at a university level a lot of that it's somewhat rare in my experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the shift to online learning and stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know especially having just graduated that people actually have to go in somewhere and take a test almost everything is online and virtual in some way and i think that's gonna follow suit with with high schooler and lower'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sometimes you do have to go to another location if you're going to take an online test just to be proctored that can still be a thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's there's some there's some that that are like that but a lot of it it at least in my university experience and and from hearing from my peers is you know a lot of it is somewhat unproctored and there are computer programs that will you know proctor you virtually or or sort of there there are ways to sort of get around that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah they watch where eyes are where your gaze is did you experience that'",
