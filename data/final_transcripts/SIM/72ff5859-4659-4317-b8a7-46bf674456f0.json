        "'speaker_3': 'thanks granita'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'perfect OK so the topic of the conversation today is should unpaid internships be illegal and maurice you'll be speaking in the favor so you you can go ahead first and make your opening statement and then we take it from there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think i think it's i mean i think it should be i think it should be illegal to not pay interns read my reasoning behind that i think is you know it's time intensive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so umm you know it it costs the interns to you know to be go into you know doing unpaid work it's stress on their lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i i believe that it shares to relieve it should be illegal i think they should be compensated for their time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as as much yes as my as much as you are saying that it's compensated time what about those who are training them shortly they are involved in this relationship of training and also'",

        "'speaker_1': 'don't you see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well have you have you ever had a really great mentor where at any cost without being paid you actually you are willing to learn and your main motivation is learning'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but juanita from companies perspective if if they are getting the work shouldn't they be paying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it depends what is your motivation this goes deeper we can't say that everything runs on money how do we learn so let's say even if you are as a small child you are learning you are no one is paying you you are having that time you are actually valuing the time what you are spending by learning something new so my perspective is that there are certain places yes where the money is motivated yet not always'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'unfortunately'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but don't you think there is an exploitation element'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'david jump'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think internships shouldn't be paid to be very sincere accompanies taking their time to train someone and now to work most knowledge are meant to be gained from schools and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'wherever you think you are because when you apply for a job you are applying that you're capable of doing a job so now when a company is offering internship you can offer that as a work experience or some sort and it makes it makes you extremely good at your work because you're learning from them so when they are teaching you how to be good at your work how do you still want to get paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as the question because you want to learn it's more or less like going to school don't you pay for your school fees'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the school doesn't pay you for coming to school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that was that internship'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i feel like any'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely david i do agree with you and this is the point that you are going there and when we look at the students as well we do pay for the studies and then we are getting something in return so it is it's a it's exchange'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you guys are missing one one fundamental sort of difference between the school and a form a company is has a product or they are providing a service they are earning money and then you're asking people to work for you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think you are missing one point very important that i it's again it's it's an exchange and it's not necessarily financial i understand that we've been taught through social media through the everything newspapers magazines and what they portray in online that everything is money money money and the lights are what it should be there but then when you look at the info'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're coming up very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the game is they are making money OK that's fair enough yet the motivation is that by doing the things so the internship as well is doing the thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right OK so you're yeah but you're but OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's true intention is actually service that is rendered from the company so what are the what are the company is selling something or they think they're running the service back to some whoever is learning from them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right OK but that's that's in certain cases but there there's a lot of exploitation out there and you going back to saying about schools schools again are businesses schools are getting paid subsidies to have students and so now it's by numbers so you saying that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which means'",
        "'speaker_4': 'students also student also do projects in schools where schools put their name on the project it's like the schools fund the project right it's more or less like the student pay for it it's part of the students payment it's the same everywhere things are never balanced but with intentions you can put it on your on your resume that you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but david if it's if you look at it from ethical point of view if you're earning millions of dollars and the school is public funded so there there is a difference'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in in terms of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that there is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it depends where you use that money it's not it's not about that that you are earning'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's going to the shareholders pockets otherwise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not necessarily not necessarily there are really good entrepreneurs who are actually and they will be well individuals who are actually investing that money what about the charities that they are investing that OK you are getting that money it's it doesn't mean you put necessarily in your pocket you are creating more jobs it depends on the ethical side as you mentioned i think before as well yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but the difference is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i get i i get get get your view that the the person who is doing the internship is is getting something in return but the company 's also getting they are getting a person who's doing some sort of work and i've done internships where i wasn't necessarily learning a lot i was doing a lot of office work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mostly no mostly now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no i feel like i feel like the person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i'm i'm and do you know what they're stressed and straight you gotta think about the stress and strain to the intern as well and again all these companies are very different so it's very difficult to generalize you know some of them we mentioned mentors now if there is if you're getting paid but you're getting really good mentorship that's gonna help you in the future fine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they come in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but a lot of them a lot of these companies out there are exploiting these interns'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and what's there to stop the companies from hiring a a lot of interns and and train to train them for like couple of months and and get like four four months of free labor'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're written'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i will'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would like to put my wedding if that's OK so there was a recent report done it it's actually he is a researcher mccracken and when he done the report on companies and it it it was exactly when the graduates are going into the labor market and they've put actually in situations where they where they met their companies and they worked for them for some time and majority of organizations they noted that people were not the new graduates they are not ready'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no there isn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the real life work so if you look from this perspective that you are taking the time as to learn and maybe there is something in a place that organization is offering you long term opportunities where in a beginning you need to get the grip of what is the organization so in this sense that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_1': 'you know you're ready for when you go into the real world because there's that catch twenty two that you're studying and you've got no you know no real experience so what they're trying to do is incorporate a lot more placement based schemes and degrees you know into universities so that you are ready and i mean then that is like your internship then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will tell you you are the lucky guy that you got it placements and internships there because the university where i might well we do not have that opportunity and it's even higher education postgraduates and still we don't have it so in this sense i mean it makes me easier and i'm looking actually at this time to have some internships and even not paid just because of sake of getting experience which i either can determine CV'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no exactly but but at the end of the but i ended the day at the end of the day if you're the end of the day you know you want to get paid for you you want to get paid for your time something is better than nothing i mean in this day and age you know the cost of living is going up but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'especially with inflation like these state it's bananas here or in europe especially like how do you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how do you expect people to survive how do you expect people to take internship'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah according to the definition of internship internship is a professional learning experience that offers many food and practical work related to students field of study of career of interest so an internship is just a learning conference student no matter whether it's whether it's using ten hours there or fifteen hours there and internship as rules and regulation you do know that right you have a certain amount of time you meant to spend there you have number of days you are meant to go there and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a learning curve and out of the intention the students gain more than the than the company because you learn more about the company look at let me give an example a student who does his internship at tesla now it does an internship at tesla you can literally work at any mechanical workshop all over the world because they believe that the knowledge gained at test now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is enough for you to participate in their company'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what why should a a multi billionaire'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely absolutely no i i'll agree with david this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no one no one one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'multibillion company should be not paying like at least a minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but you can imagine they are sharing with you the knowledge they are sharing something exactly exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why should probably pay you for getting money from them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but they should at least they should be least be paying ext they should be at least at least be paying expenses whether it's travel expenses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why'",
        "'speaker_3': 'traveling his spending his time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why should i pay you for when it's come and learn from me it's a question it's a question why should i pay you please comma learn from me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then what's the point of schools so if we should get rid of schools altogether'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're trying to gain an experience for me you're trying to use my name because no matter what i teach you my name'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now yeah but you but OK but you're speaking for a point of view right there are some internships where you there you're gonna gain valuable you know valuable kind of information knowledge and experience now from my point of view i worked in an investment bank one you know one of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you put some of them on the rating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well you know one of the world 's best investment banks but they were taking on internships and they were basically getting the interns to do the work of a full time employee who would you know would be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'documentation copying getting copies all sorts of things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well now look look at this even when you what you are saying what you are saying right i will pick on david 's actually point still so let's say it translate letting them internships right they are actually allowing someone to have a peek inside in a company which has a breakthrough engineering right so you are actually from the company side you are risking as well that someone can come in and do something similar you are creating competitors as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that was expectation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do you have that those interns have access to sensitive information or they're just doing the daily tasks that can anyone do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'most of the most most of them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh if you if you are doing daily tasks you are doing manual work so what your internship what was your motivation to go get that what what's your what are you going to learn that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i need you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because i didn't have any other opportunity and i just wanted some experience on my CV because otherwise no company would give me a interview call and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and again you put the number of the company in the resume'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then that you achieved it because you wanted something to put on CV so you put it on your CV so what are you complaining about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how how how is it different from volunteer work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like i said someone who did especially at this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can put volunteer on TV yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's only an extensive consistent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you're helping a cause rather than making someone else rich'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think that i think i think that i think they need to rebalance i definitely think there needs to be a balance and there is definitely a reports out there of companies who are exploiting people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know to be honest with you there's quite a lot of companies out there who do pay internships'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i think you know again something is better than nothing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know as we said all these sayings time is money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know you'll get them to work a little bit harder if they're getting a little if they're getting compensated somehow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'did you feel do you guys feel it's it's possible in this day and age to live in in let's say a a city like berlin where i live is it possible for us to survive on an unpaid internship and then to some sort of side hustle to just to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think i did you more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make the ends meet'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah if you wanna if you want if you want to burn yourself out yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK let's be fat you are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i would i would disagree again with that because usually what we are speaking about internships that will be either you are just a new new graduate right or you are a student even still or if you are someone who is in a second stage of the life who is reconsidering the career you would have some backup because you have your learnings what you've done so in this case you are not risking that much and that internship is just as a stepping stone to your really big goal so if you look from this perspective'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is not exploitative it's exploitation when someone is really putting a child to work in a factory or put someone on the conditions which are dangerous to them that is exploitation all when it's someone really enslaving someones flavor but in this you are choosing you have a choice essentially in the western world we have a choice'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but but how is it different from from from the scenario that you just just explained of sweatshops because those kids in third world they don't have any other means to earn money and so so they they are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but we can't we can't call that intention'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's ethics of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can argue there there they are learning a skill as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and also adults could be exploited as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the element'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not scale no that's not learning skill i'm sorry the child is not supposed to work that's about the ethics and the moral ground'",
        "'speaker_4': 'most exploitation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's probably is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but but otherwise they're gonna stop they they don't have any other means to how do you sort of grapple with that dilemma'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doesn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i can't i can't i can't solve for them the issues but at this point but my point is what we westerners have we have a power that when we are we make better choices and we know and look forward how we can help those who struggle the most to bring them out as well and this is a very very big gap and if we speak about in friendships this might be that learning stone what we take here small small cost'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think i i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when we compare ourselves to the children who are struggling to the adults who don't have food to put on the table this is the small burden for us to bear and yet we can make a very big difference'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i also think i want to put something on that for my example from africa again in africa a lot of people take internship for something like a cobbler shoemaker mechanic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh for all these for many jobs people take intention for that and the students who learn mostly are less privilege and couldn't even afford school which is due to abject poverty but one thing is that when the keep learning that one thing the boss try to do is that for a student that they know they can't afford to even learn or the money is not there they tend to always try to get them food and probably tell them you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you can come stay with me but with companies companies in europe where the company that is able to pay and because company takes information about everyone they employ right and they know that this is a less privileged person this is someone who is not capable of even playing for an internship or this is more like the person is just trying to sort out for a job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they left the company is using that person in such a way that it's not an internship and that person doesn't have time to get an extra job to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feed themselves that's exploitation that's exploitation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i get i i get i get your point do you guys think that is is there a better way than this internship system altogether it is there a better mechanism that we can sort of adapt is just society or that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well in the in in the US in the US they tried to you know they tried to put a system in place where you know where interns get paid so they're trying to put that in in place so there's no reason that they can't put it in place in europe and to be honest with you most of the most of the bigger larger corporations in the UK for instance do pay their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maurice'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i think we'll'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it was networking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it's very good it's very good because he was making some some kind of points which i did not like you can't compare to america'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mary sweet really celebrated you dropping out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i'm still i'm still here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can you can you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we did not hear you what you said'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can you hear me can you sorry can you hear me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we can hear you yeah yeah go for it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but before we could not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh maybe i think i might have pressed the mute button on my'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe you said something about the US that they didn't like and they were like we need to stop this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's it it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no trump is not a president at the moment it should be fine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you were giving us insights into the matrix so they were like we need to cut this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no what they're trying to they're trying to put schemes in place but it's nothing to do with nothing to do with trump nothing to do with the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the CIA or anything'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no nothing to do with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you said nothing to me in trouble'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'guys'",
        "'speaker_1': 'unfortunately the world we live in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes unfortunately so you were talking about the the US plan to overcome this problem'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah internships i think paid internships yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah not yeah yeah so they're trying to put something in place where they you know where there's no exploitation of interns and there is some type of compensation and such not a lot again but something is better than nothing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'morris just to push back on that point uh do do don't you think it it sort of creates more risk for companies to hire someone who hasn't have any sort of formal training or not everyone is sort of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ready after school to work in in in our organization and there will be more willing to get those people on board and give them exposure if they're not they don't have any sort of monetary'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh sort of reasons like like they they're not paying them out so don't you think they will be less reluctant to hire people fresh off school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well again they they you know again they don't just hire anybody they you know they they try to vet people to see who it would be beneficial for it's not a case of them just taking anybody because they don't give internships to anybody everybody had to go through an application process generally'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well that you know that this resembles to what i was saying about the graduate before so my point my view on the soil is that actually their workplaces need to have better integration with educational institutions so they can get a greater value for both sides because while the students are studying they are actually paying tuition fees which organizations actually can use as a placement as a job experience where they compose both of them and i see that as a win win situation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
