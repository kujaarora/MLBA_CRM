    "Should the minimum wage be increased? Does minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of their employees?": [
        "'speaker_1': 'makita and i will be your moderator today before we're gonna start this conversation i'd like to test everyone's audio please say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'gaze unmute yourself please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and our topic of the discussion today is should the minimum wage be increased and does the minimum wage allow companies to take advantage of their employees do any of you guys have like really strong opinions on this subject'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i have a really strong opinion on the topic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK say it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm well my opinion on the topic is that it's it's a little bit more nuanced than'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then called for by the question that you know should minimum wage be raised'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's really asking the question to me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do you want to use this as a manner'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to keep democracy alive by finding ways to give people that have less a little bit so that they can survive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and if they can if cause that's that's what's that's what sets democracies apart from other forms of government as we help people that don't have enough to help themselves'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and so if you want to raise minimum wage to help people get that standard of living then i think that's a justifiable reason for raising it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so so mainly the political aspect of that that you know we need to have rather reasonably rich public for for the democracy to run and they they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no they should be super poor'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would say if you want i would go so i would go further to say that if you want to have a democracy you have to have ways to get people who have less enough so that they can get by'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's what separates democracy and other forms of govern'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true true i mean that that that's reasonable OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh what about you guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that depends because so mine take on it is my family they're farmers so they live in a state with a high minimum wage because there are bigger cities that require it which totally works for a bigger city but it does not trickle down to the little guys who have to now pay this minimum wage so like john was saying yes i understand that but what about the people who having to pay that same amount of minimum wage but are not like these big companies that are able to afford that minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i really i i really really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'small businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah sorry i just wanted to say i agree with the crystals point like this minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'luna please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'policy is more effective for big corporations or multinational companies but it it it would have more negative impacts on small businesses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they may not be able to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vina vin come to you know maybe pay this minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes so they would not be able to pay it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'one of the reasons that one of the reasons that i said it was more nuanced than that is because i knew if the if you start saying you need to do a minimum wage like that that's a blunt hammer object where that something that needs to be more surgical because there's no way i feel i feel for small business i'm not automatically for it because i feel for small businesses i don't feel for corporations so that's why i'm saying there are other ways to do that like for instance you could provide people with health care and then they wouldn't need a raise at work if their healthcare was paid for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that could be done across the board and not hurt anybody differently'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but it's it's that's that's why to me it distills down to are we going to care for people that don't have enough to care for themselves or not and if we're not then which is kind of the way it feels like a lot of the the one party feels in this country right now it you know that everybody should just be responsible for themselves and that's it and period'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's that may be a legitimate point of view but if you're saying that what i'm saying to you is that you're giving up on democracy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah kind of agree with john'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true but i i guess the point there will be that you know who should government support in this there is a conflict between you know people who employ employees and and people who just work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know they maybe have different interests and should government be involved in deciding who should be supported'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in this way'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think there should be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like should we should it be the state that you know dictates'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what the minimum wage is and what the how much they should pay or should it be more agreement between you know a small business owner for example and people who work there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it depends on the type of company that it is like for the small businesses you give them you know loans and stuff but then you're essentially taking that money back because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sure you give him a loan but then they have to pay their employees so much so it either needs to be based on the county that they live in because it's all the counties typically are gonna either be a big city or not or it needs the type of business that's run like if it's a small business then maybe the government supports a third of that minimum wage that they're saying you have to pay'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because it totally depends on the local and if it's a it in different countries there are different economic growth so in countries in really developed countries'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know and i have to say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well we'll the the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the minimum wage would be higher than in underdeveloped countries so again it changes with the economic growth of the country i guess'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's not except'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you can't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'except it doesn't it the the whole reason i i wanted to respond to your you know should the government intervene well the government did not intervene'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the last thirty or forty years in this country and the wages have remained stagnant for poor people and gone up for rich people and so the state has to intervene because the unregulated market and the trickle down economics and all the things that we said we're supposed to happen if we just left markets alone never happened rich people got richer and poor people got poor and so that requires an intervention'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you want to have a democracy like if you don't then let everybody go you know every man for himself and that's it but that's not a democracy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there must be government intervention up to a certain point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there needs to be government invent intervention to a certain point because like you said there should be some sort of you know societal equality like you know the rich can't just keep on getting richer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know they they move it demotivates the poor it doesn't give an incentive to work like no matter how much i'm gonna work i'm only getting this much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like you know the the poor people should get a chance to but real chance at you know working to beat it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or at least to live to survive in the society'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the count argument that would be well so be it you know if somebody makes more money they deserve it and you know they they they sometimes they it's connected to the will of god or something like that sometimes it just connected to the you know capitalism and will of the market'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if they make more money so why not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the only people that feel that's the the only people that feel that's sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no just like it's so if they make more money why not uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the only for food feel like that's the will of god rich people you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and maybe rich people are more important for the for the country than the poor one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no but that's not right like we need everybody needs to have like an opportunity to live or survive like minimum wages necessary otherwise how are they gonna live like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because the things are increasing and the minimum wage should'",
        "'speaker_4': 'change with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you should not just because you can't say hard work is everything you can't expect someone to work hard without the basic necessities they need for life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the idea there is that the market should decide that that you know if somebody offers money that you know that you cannot live on then probably nobody gonna work for them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we just did the we just gone through we've just got in the united states we've just gone through thirty years of testing that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just because you know it's pointless'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it doesn't work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we don't it's not even really it's not even really up for debate whether it works or not if you're talking about income equality'",
        "'speaker_1': 'little but we do have minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'where in new and who talks about income inequality'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm sorry i run run run terminology just the just the just the capacity to have a basic standard of living'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no baby because we do have minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and my point is and my point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so do do do do you think minimum wage should be connected to this minimum living wage in this way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i do because i i i think with the caveat as i've been saying all along if you wanna call yourself a democracy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and if you want to stand up with the kind of things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like i'm not i'm not sure where you're coming with the democracy because a lot of like no democratic countries have minimum wage and it's rather common'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that doesn't that that's beside that's beside the point and i've also said that the minimum wage is just one way that you can sort of redistribute wealth so that poor people can get by and have a minimum standard of living so i'm not locked in i've never locked into the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but if i said if you wanna use it as a tool to help rebalance the economics that have been thrown out of balance by people that have taken advantage of the system in the opposite direction because when people talk about we'll just let the market room well prior to nineteen the mid nineteen eighties there was a law that said you could only pay your stockholders so much money and all the rest of that money had used for other purposes and those purposes were to improve facilities pay people more money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'provide health care and do all that kind of stuff well and the you know the the trickle down economics ronald reagan people came in and changed that so there was no limit on how much you could pay your stockholders so guess what you know employees wages have not gone up while all the people that run the companies wages have exploded'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean that that that's true but i i think the idea behind the rig and economics was that you know greed is good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that it makes people to invest more and rely more on investment versus the kind of just salaries and work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and we bought into that and we've been living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but too much greed is not good too much of anything is not good it needs there needs to be a balance right now the the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'falls in the rich people 's court'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i'm true that's i'm i'm but you can say that you know since they reached they're more powerful and that's why you know they they're making the rules'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think something that we have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well since it's a democracy since it's a democracy not only did it people should have a voice and making the rules'",
        "'speaker_4': 'everyone should everyone should be given that opportunity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and then and you have a way you won't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's how you you know most of the people practice their democratic you know rights by voting and electing the officials'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who theoretically can should represent them and they interests'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and all in all of those people that all those people that feel that way voted people in to government here in a manner where they can't even elect they can't even elect a representative for the first time in a hundred years'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what what yeah that's we end in that situation but do do do you think it is connected to the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the minute to me the minimum wage symbolizes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the a site of struggle in in in again in democracy where the thing that the thing that makes this country the united states i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'makes makes it makes it something special is that despite all the grift and despite everything that you see you know at the end of the day when when the chips are really down we tend to we tend to take care of people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and and and and we have systematic ways of doing that that other countries don't we have democratic systematic ways of doing that that other countries don't have that i think make us a better place to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well grease the please join us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i don't know i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'despite'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i feel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because there is a good discussion about the democracy and how you know you know great things in america are but then you know should it be the farmers in the more rural areas who need to pay for for all that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will be paying the higher minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and on whom it will be all kind of you know pressed on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even with minimum wage i think sometimes it like john was saying about how it keeps the poor people poor like yes that's a minimum but that doesn't even like i think it needs to be reflected on i don't know where they get their numbers from but as far as like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just how to what you can live with and it needs to be regulated more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because i know like i have a salary job but the part i was living in like i was barely able to keep up with that and that's not that's living above minimum wage so even though people like there's a minimum wage out there but the price of rat and everything it it's not comparable when you get to that bare minimum wage even though it's gone up it's still not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can't get on top of the bills and everything because everything with inflation has increased so much that the minimum wage hasn't increased with it and the government hasn't figured out how to find that suite formula for to keep the small businesses in business and to make sure that the rich are paying their dues in order to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'keep it a fair game'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes i really agree that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so maybe that's why'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but isn't that the idea that if it will increase the minimum wage it actually will increase the inflation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because there are more like like the people more poor people who have more money they they poor people have a tendency to spend all their money like here and now because both in order to survive versus to invest somewhere in the pond or something so and if we are putting more money into poor people you know that it actually will increase the inflation and it will take away any benefit that we are getting further increase of the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so to be a lot smarter to keep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that can be solved the government decides to like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'invest in like like teach the poor people how to save money like you know worker education programs that would help a lot for like sparring options'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i guess the idea that's not only minimum wage but we need to more additional social programs right to keep everything running'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah they should be yeah there should be minimum wage along with social awareness program'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just like how we have to pay into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our health insurance in some way there should be me thing where if you're gonna increase this minimum wage like maybe part of it just automatically like how other jobs might have a a a four oh one K or something maybe that should be something that's more mandated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that people are having this retirement and when they get to the retirement age or they can get to that age they have that money we're not taking it all from social security or whatever it is and you know like you said having those programs that so the poor don't just keep staying poor but they can have these this education and these programs to help them invest in their future'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think this is i these comments are really getting at what the something i think that it it's really critical and that is those are those are those are ways that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those those those interventions only happen through government programs i don't think there's any evidence that private sector left alone will take care of people that way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well sure but i i guess that's why we we do have minimum wage as a concept and you know as like but like i i guess all of us kind of agree that current minimum wage is minimum wage is not enough'",
        "'speaker_1': 'did does it mean that we need just to increase it and that will you know keep keeps everything solved'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's too it's too simple to it's too it's too complicated to to have a yes or no i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think mcdonald's should have a higher minimum wage and i think if somebody wants to start a small independent store in my little downtown i don't think you know they should they may maybe they should get some slack because they have fewer people and less resources you know maybe it should be a based on how much profit you make or how much you use the highways or something i don't know but i do feel for the small people the small business people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but then then why are you gonna work for the small business company you if you know they they're gonna pay you less than the mcdonald's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well then you would have to be doing something really cool wouldn't you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whoa'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hopefully ohh at least you know you're in place you should have other sources of income'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i guess that is like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'somebody will fill somebody will fill that niche you know i mean i would rather you know and i don't know you know the answer is the answer is i'm i'm spitballing that part i don't i don't have a good answer for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think something else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry i think the wedge of like it should adjust with the inflation rate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like umm there should be as it should depend on the inflation that type of business the area the economic growth the area because you can't like you can't give a minimum wage for all the states in the US because there are different living costs in different areas that are different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some economic growth in different areas in some places would have more concentrate concentration of large corporations while others would have more small business so it you you need to tailor the minimum wage to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'eight or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or to the place you're trying to cater cater it to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so so it needs to be connected to the delivery of age and the local living wage and you know minimum wage in california and minimum wage in tennessee you know should be different'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think age plays a factor too because i know as far as the farming community goes like a lot of they might hire like twelve or fourteen year old someone just to get their feet wet with working and their work ethic so they're not working a ton of hours but they're still needing that minimum wage like why does a fourteen year old need to be making that fourteen fifteen dollars an hour and you know i mean most times they're not needing that much money like maybe there should be like a step process of like you know you can work so many hours so this is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'minimum wage for this many hours or something of that nature'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well as i remember like on the H people they they have restrictions on how many hours they can work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and because they still need to go to school and stuff'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cool yes cool is very important'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they have restriction on hours but not how much they get'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well OK OK let let me open alternative in this way so you yes you know minimum wage is usually connected to you know trying to keep poor people closer to the living wage but do you think the universal basic income should be involved in that and kind of that it should not be the burden on the businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to keep everyone not poor but you know should government be involved maybe not in the minimum wage but providing money directly in universal basic income version'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean you can't expect businesses to you know take up the entire burden because then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like they mean like for example if in a if in US it's a minimum wage is in someone 's on moms of dollars and they can see that in underdeveloped countries you can get the same amount of work done in with lesser cost we would you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah transfer the work so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah they will go there they will move there you know production facilities somewhere you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so the people of US like yes so the natives US they won't be able to like their job opportunities would decrease and stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the cheaper labor'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so the business should not take all the burden and yes the government should obviously put in a helping hand'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but when it comes to the universal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'income and yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'basic income yeah uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the universal basic income like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like yeah for basic essentials you need but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how does universal basic income and with minimum'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the the idea is that for example the there are different versions of doing that but usually government provides like every citizen is getting the certain amount of money no matter of what just just because of being citizen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean that would what is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like you're getting i don't know a thousand dollars a month that let's say just for being an american citizen and that the idea the main idea there that it is the universal so everybody gets it and that kind of supposed to keep them closer to their living wage that even if you don't do like you know the the great job very well paid job it it gives you enough money to survive so you are using it as an opportunity to either pursue other career'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or maybe to i don't know walk in a place that cannot pay you that much or trying to be your kind of you know businessman and try do do that things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but would that motivate people to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so instead of the instead of the employee the government pays you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but would would that that would eventually definitely cause some people to not work they wouldn't be motivated for to work there wouldn't be a need to work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean thousand dollars'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well moneys not the only reason why people work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and that's the the idea that it is very minimal it it it helps you not to die'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but maybe instead of money they should be just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know it doesn't provides you a like a full living wage like like really a good life'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah maybe instead of money they should be giving the basic services instead of money cause cash can be used'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in any way just given to an individual'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK and that that's one of the maybe not not not in the form of money but more in the form of services OK what do you guys think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'got some basic services yeah can be provided by the government that would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that would definitely help'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think some of it too is education like our education sucks system sucks as far as higher education because i know with my profession i am paying way more in student loans than like i probably pay half and student loans and compared to half of what i make a year like it's not the amount that we have to pay in order to get a piece of paper that says you're qualified for this type of job is even worth the the amount that it costs to do it so i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of people don't end up going to university because it's like well why do i want to spend all that money and be in debt when i can stay afloat but not have all that extra debt so i think if universities were more of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like the way they do it in different countries would help bring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'free or cheaper high education'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and probably healthcare that's you know usually everyone talks about that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well thank you yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah education and healthcare go to those points are very important'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright OK so so maybe not direct money but services as you know healthcare education may like i i know another aspect of that usually like for the woman 's rights it's more like a kindergartens or kind of daycare the that is sometimes provided so they can keep working'",
        "'speaker_1': 'while having children'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's one of the aspect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes i know people have that struggle though the daycare is ends up being where like i've looked at it too like if i were to have kids why am i gonna work if you have my spouse work because if i'm gonna go back to work and still pay this the same amount that i would end up bringing home to stay with my kids i'd rather stay home with my kids than having to just break even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true true that that's one of the aspect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think one of the things that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so i get uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'one of the things i'm hearing coming up in in the in some of the comments'",
        "'speaker_1': 'junk list'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just really reminds me that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there there are there are people entire subgroups of people that go from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh one poor paying job to another job just to make it and part of the argument if you just like leave markets alone and let everybody be and the cream will rise to the top if you're gonna if you're gonna implement that and if somebody starting with a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt and thirty thousand dollars in credit card debt and the person next to them has neither of those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's not a fair race'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the people that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but maybe the idea is that you know if somebody managed to get the education and healthcare which one would getting into debt that you know that's good for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they these deserve that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK and i'm not saying that those i and and there's an argument made there that's called the horatio alger alger argument here that gets brought up a lot where it's it's the bootstrap argument that it's india rugged individualism that you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps and it's it's it's interesting it's the the people to a person that a spouse that view are people that are wealthy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because they don't understand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well at first it first of all is a is a form of physicist let me tell you that you cannot pull yourself through your bootstraps the main point there that it is impossible'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but it's like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like i keep hearing it but like i i'm pretty sure it's impossible'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's the reality of it too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but that's and the reality of it that's that's what they say though'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the reality of it is really hard you can't keep pulling up yourself like how long can you do that if nothing around you you know it's not helping you i mean you know to survive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK that that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i guess we're kind of we're agreeing that we need more social programs and maybe some increase of minimum wage sometimes that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the the the kind of the point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah depending on the economic growth and inflation yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just said like think about it and and i don't know if i agree with that i i think i think as i think about it and i'm hearing listening'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think i think we've been really based inequality and we have a need for some equity now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'back into each way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what i'm saying is that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and instead of an equal distribution of resources and equitable situation would mean that you'd give more resources to people that have less and give them a chance to catch up so that everybody has a fair shot somehow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i still don't know if that's you know minimum raising minimum wage i don't know that that will i don't know if that'll work or not you know but that's a that's an effort in the right direction i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well uh huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we're not sure if if yeah the difference between quality and equitable like you're not sure if raising the minimum wage would do that but it would be a step in the right direction but if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'other like we mentioned the social awareness programs and a bunch of other stuff are implemented together along with the it would make a significant difference'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK krista please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree with those just because there's i mean a lot of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'different types of groups like you're going to have that constant cycle of my parents didn't so this is what i'm doing but then you also have the i get a lot from my family as far as like well when i was younger i could do blah blah blah but they're not standing OK cool but you had dual income or you had you know you didn't have to pay this much for college or you were able to buy a house super cheap compared to like i'm a single income and i'm trying to do all this on top of it i just having that generation of awareness'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's before we saw your debt'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that too well you know it's an example i can give my my former father-in-law and he could finish university just by walking in the retail store like minimum wage job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and it was enough to pay for his degree which is clearly not impossible now so but so i guess the ratio between the minimum wage and you know cost of higher education for example was rather different like fifty sixty years ago'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes it was definitely different and that plays a major factor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and many of the basic services like healthcare education how many people are able to access this or or as we say poor people are unable to access it and during this time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'compared to before'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well thank you very much for the great discussion i think i will stop the recording and i hope you will guys come back later for more discussions we we'll have more topics and thank you very much'",
