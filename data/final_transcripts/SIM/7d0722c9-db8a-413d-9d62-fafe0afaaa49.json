        "'speaker_3': 'i was surprised to see that i thought we were kind of past that that that it was the the degree or the experience but it seems to be they want both at least where i was looking and what i was looking at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'depending on the type of jobs and it just it's like well it almost seems like no i can understand in the sense of the ones that say they wanted to agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then why do you want us to have this much experience first because what if i can't right after college you can't get into something even some things you can't just volunteer to get the experience even if you didn't want to you still sometimes had to volunteer but some of the stuff you can't get the experience without having a job but if certain'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fields don't want you to or can't you know like don't wanna hire you as a like an introductory thing like as a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then it's like how am i ever gonna get the experience that these other ones want'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i had a friend um this was like kind of a long time ago umm say like before the two thousand eight housing bubble burst or whatever and she worked in computers like kind of like IT and she did not have a degree but she had like a couple great jobs like she switched from job to job got a couple like really high paying really great jobs and then like sort of the housing bubble burst and the economy got bad around that time and she lost her job and suddenly they started asking her like when she tried to find a new job to get a degree and it's like she didn't have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'she you know did did she have a degree is what they were asking she didn't have one and like she couldn't get another job and i was kind of shocked it's like because you know she was doing the job and clearly like it like you either know how to do it or you don't like you can kind of get the computer working for other people in the company or you can't and it's like so it was like you know kind of unclear to me like why like why are they using this criteria and i sometimes wonder if it's just like a way to separate people out like they get just a whole bunch of applications'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it's like you've gotta weed them down somehow as to who you're gonna call in for an interview so maybe they just you know the ones with no degrees go in one pile and the ones with the degrees go in another pile i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's been happening a lot too and and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a lot of times i would hear that well if you if you have a degree that kinda is an indicator that you can sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'set a goal for yourself and achieve it and i've i've heard that before so that's that's that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that's my thought it's not it's not even about what degree it is it's that you can commit to something and finish it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right and which is pretty important but as we've been saying it does depend what you're trying to accomplish in the career you're trying to work and and whatnot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i know that for example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'economics or statistics and math those kind of things those really important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it requires a lot of a lot of studying a lot of knowledge and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you don't really get you know you work your way up i mean you could certainly learn on your own but you don't really necessarily get those jobs you know sort of working your way up and getting promoted and whatnot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah there's a lot of companies as you were saying i'm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they do sort of just from the get go they get all these applications and there's like a lot of these people don't just boom that's it but i always tend to wonder why if it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if say someone does obviously have more experience and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as we were saying i guess it's this sort of this indicator but wouldn't job experience also be the same i mean i don't know if it's there's just sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'd really like so what what companies tend to think when they just see someone with fifteen years of experience or ten years of experience at least and then they see it just a fresh college graduate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what exactly i think a lot like what what exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are they really going for and i just tend to just go back to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess it's a good indicator for some and so but i've seen people get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'land jobs in and they have no degree in whatsoever and it's not what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're even studying and they're just starting over fresh in a completely new career and there's like ohh i'd never or they might post something on on social media like ohh i've never really thought i'd be doing this and this is what i do now and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it the main or one of the factors is because you just have a degree they don't really specify which kind of degree you just need to have the bachelors degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so it can be a bit of both right i mean it sort of depends but nowadays a lot of companies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the most part for example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'glass door everyone we don't know glass door the the that right the so that website released an article i forgot i think it was in like twenty twenty'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because i remember reading it and the headline was fifteen big companies that are no longer requiring a college degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that really isn't the trend so i can argue that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not and a lot of company it's not required and a lot of companies aren't needing it but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not really what's happening for the most part the majority of the time they're just simply wanting to degree without really caring too much about the degree what kind of degree it is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so just i guess sort of fine line'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right like my friend her degree was was health administration and she got a job with a company doing tech sales that doesn't hire anyone without a degree but i mean that that her degree is useless in that field but you know they still hired her because she's got a degree on her resume'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i don't know if this is too far afield but in a weird way like i feel like requiring that degree especially when it doesn't really have any relationship to the job like it's almost like a little bit classist right because you have to have money to like go to college to get a degree i unless you're lucky enough to get like you know a scholarship or something or like you're you're taking out loans what which then you have to pay back so it's like it's sort of just admit it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'man'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feel like the degree gives an advantage to people like it's easier for people with money to get a degree i guess so if then it's easier for you to get a job if you have a degree then aren't we just kind of like setting society up to help people that come from money i don't know that's just my thought'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's what it seems like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it it's it's i mean it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'too far fetched i mean a lot of people do i mean i i have an associates i'm i'm on my way to just get a bachelors but i don't i never took out a loan i'm not i don't come from a family with money but then again you can sort of see that reflect and just be honest i mean i could have easily maybe immediately got into a maybe a better college because i just simply had the money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe if i don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if i wasn't able to apply and it successfully get the scholarship'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but for the most part a lot of people we we we can all just basically agree if you have them have the money you can basically do a lot of things and it's gonna be gonna be it's gonna be a lot easier it's just that's how it is and a lot of people argue that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the whole thing is sort of like this business but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess for the most part you it just it would be a lot harder but i would say that as far as the classes sort of the notion that it's sort of like this class this thing i mean i guess it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm not surprised if that is sort of the case and i'm not it's not something that i would immediately dismiss because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it two controversial but a lot of people a lot of companies nowadays are specifically hiring certain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'specifically because they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a certain kind of person like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they fit the mold of what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the fit the right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what they're looking for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sort of and so that they can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess seem more uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'inclusive fuel and so that that a lot of that is going on too and so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's starting to go beyond'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sort of the scope of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which degree how knowledgeable they are and sometimes it goes beyond even the degree and experience so you can have someone have a degree that's necessary and you can have also another applicant that has the experience but then they'll both not get hired'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because they see someone else who kind of fits the kind of like you said the mode if you will so there's that going on and so that's why it kind of makes it a little bit more of a tricky topic to kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because if it's going to have a degree counting it needs to be you know like as we've kind of been you know saying it needs to be in the same field like as the one that they're applying because if they're ohh yeah i got a degree like i got a degree in broadcasting ohh yes so we'll just let you into this you know like let you into this you know tool operating you know like a mechanic you know not a mechanic but like you know big warehouse or something what does let you in there just because you have a degree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh revolve around'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it may be for broadcasting and you don't know anything about these i get what you're talking about about how the experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know so that's the thing if they're gonna require a degree or experience'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please have it be the degree that goes with that i'm sorry but you know it's gotta be because if not why would you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i mean it's a good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'even do you even look even though it says they have a degree to even look to see or are you just trying to make yourself look good as a company and say ohh we just wanna make sure we can say we have people in college it's all about the numbers or people that have been through it but what if they don't have the right stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know what if they don't have'",

        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just because they have seven years of work experience make sure it can connects with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",

        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would say make sure that both you know like if you really want to require both make sure that they both connect to it you know don't just say ohh you have a degree so it you know it counts'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well and i've heard from from you know larger companies that get applications you know constantly they don't even review them themselves they almost have like this bot or something that just looks for keywords and then you know those specific resumes get to the right desk and i don't know you know the keywords would be degrees or whatever it may be'",

        "'speaker_2': 'for the most part or either or and that will determine how they go about hiring people because there are actual scores i remember reading up on the gaming company no no microsoft i'm sorry specifically xbox which are owned by microsoft'",

        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right it needs to be the type of degree because even though harvard it doesn't mean that you know like you'd you'd had to just see'",

        "'speaker_1': 'technical things that go into that'",

        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because if i hired a harvard person that was clearly like inappropriate because they were i don't know whatever if i hired them as a lawyer when they went to med school or something then i could still be criticized for sure but you know but if i hired like whatever the harvard doctor for a doctor thing and then he screwed up it's like well you know what do i know like he went to harvard thought he would be good it's not my fault i hired him i don't know'",
