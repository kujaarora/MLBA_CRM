        "'speaker_2': 'i have to be diplomatic as well so yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK frankie'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah even me too it's like the same like there is not like a single answer i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like it's it's not a straightforward answer like yes or no from me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are several arguments like which are in favor and which are against'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah OK so what what jump into we'll go over some you know some scenarios and different things and we'll we can uh discuss that so you know as far as let's go first so somebody that i guess in certain situations is is against unpaid internships what situations would those be where you you think they should be illegal it's a certain industries certain jobs what are those cases'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the tech jobs or finance medical those kind of domains which has more social responsibility so those domains should never be unpaid like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we are indirectly making the future so they should feel motivated while working or learning something new so those internships should never be unpaid wireless fashion entertainment publishing arts those i mean by no means this domains are less important or they have less responsibilities but you know the number of people who wants this job are outnumber the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'actual internships available so it's like supply and demand which is not matching so i think tech jobs finance medical those domains should be always paid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that's the i'll go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so go ahead go ahead jim'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i think that's a really good point about the level of responsibility i guess my main argument on why it should be illegal is that it limits who gets the opportunities i actually had the opportunity to do an unpaid internship when i was in college and i had the privilege of staying with my parents who supplied me with a car and housing and food and anyone who would not have those some sort of a financial backing or financial support would be i don't know how you could do an unpaid internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'without that so i really dislike the fact that it limits who can get the opportunity because i do think an internship is a great opportunity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah go go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even i agree with like because not not like a particular industry like even every industry needs to be like it should be not i mean the people who are doing internships should be paid because literally they are doing work which has to be done by the person who is employed actually they are literally grabbing the opportunity of an employee but still they're not getting paid especially yeah so that's what i feel like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'internships must be paid especially when yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and also while doing an internship uh we are not just changing a job or we are not just changing the domain we are changing the city we will be living in a new apartment so you know if that's city is more expensive we will be having high gas prices high living expenses and you know it's not even while doing an internship it's not even profit it's not even'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh you know no profit no loss it's a complete loss like your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'giving money out of your own pocket to do an internship so i'm quite against of this uh mindset of having unpaid internship at least minimum wages should be given to an employee or a student'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i worry about abuse too i think it opens the door to taking advantage of young people who are you know new to the workforce and maybe don't know protocols and what's generally acceptable and generally not acceptable so i really wonder if the fact that you're viewed as you know not being paid there's already a and you're younger less experienced if there isn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'opportunities for people to really take advantage of young people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you guys think uh there's also you know kind of a a line if somebody is currently still in school and college versus somebody who's finished their degree how big of a factor is that for you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i yeah that's a good point like i don't think there is much difference'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like the students who are not yet graduated uh they are more in vulnerable situation they don't have much experience they will just take it whatsoever comes in their path so they'll not consider what's good for them if it's unpaid like no one wants to be unpaid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know at least minimum wages everyone want but you know they know the fact that if they will not take it someone else will take it and later in future they will it will increase their chances to get hired and yeah they'll be earning who knows more than the one who did not opt to go for unpaid internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah it's like especially the new companies new startups who don't have funding they are doing this this sort of thing like recruiting the interns and without paying them their making sure that their work is done and even students i mean even nowadays nowadays students are also like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean companies are also to get a job they are also they are they are also required like as particular internship previously have you done they are asking like have you done any internship previously so this this this also makes the companies to take an opportunity like they are exploiting this situation like to give internships without any pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that being said though i do think that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know i don't feel this as strongly as i do that you know it limits who can have the opportunity but it could be a win win situation where like you mentioned kranthi startups that don't have the budget it gives it could be a win for them they got somebody to help whose interested and on the interns side it gives them job experience networking they could get letters of recommendation find out if that's a field that they would want to pursue or maybe that's not for them so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can't see scenarios where it could be a win win for the company and for the student as long as maybe there aren't some oversight or some clearly defined parameters on you know what's involved'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with both of you i agree with both of you because in startups they don't have much fundings but they have the best learnings you know in big companies in big organizations they'll not pay much attention to you they like the strength will be too much they have many more tasks to do so in boots in companies who are like just initiated or it's a bootstrap company they will not have many people so they will invest their times to teach you to you know make you able to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know work on your own so that is the best learning you can have in a startup company so even if it's unpaid it's up to you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's up to an individual who should take it or not but i would say like in in startups if it's startups internships should be i i would not say it should be but yeah if it's unpaid it's fair enough'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ishan do you think there should be an expectation of maybe a job down the line is is that something that should be maybe articulated or is that something that an intern shouldn't expect i'm talking about like these startups and stuff that are quickly growing and expanding'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean they do let us know while interviewed itself that we for example if i'm appearing for an interview in a startup company they will let me know if i'm doing this job or that job so it's up to me who should decide if it's the best fit for me or not so yeah we definitely have a rough idea about what we will be doing in that company so it's up to us who should choose if it's good start for us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be unpaid or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because at the end of the day there is there's value to an internship or at least at i'd say some to most internships i guess the the question being then is how how do you stop companies from taking advantage of unpaid internships just using them as you know the gopher work versus somebody who's actually learning the industry is getting some really valuable worthwhile experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i feel that at least i mean i said ishan as earlier mentioned about like the student would relocate to a particular place where the company is located and then he would work from there so at least the the company should make sure that the guys getting like the student is getting at least the minimum allowances of rent or living expenses in a particular city or so again the if the intent is coming from the poor background'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like we really difficult for him to get into and focus on the work rather he he has to do some other side jobs to to make make his living'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even if not money they should you know a sponsor their living expense at least so it it feels like even just privileged people can afford unpaid internships the people who come from middle class or poor background they cannot afford to go with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'unpaid internship even if they don't have choice they have to stick to the unemployment ship the harsh part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one thing i'm curious about is i mentioned i did do an unpaid internship but they paid me i think it was discretionary and i can see the benefits that maybe if i was coming late all the time or it didn't work out i can sort of see the benefits'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and for not paying someone just to make sure as this is gonna work out because it is a temporary setup but i i guess i'm curious about how rare that is that an unpainted unpaid internship actually ends up there is payment at the end it just wasn't tied to the initial agreement'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's more common in the US i guess uh i don't know where you guys are from but i'm in germany and mostly i've seen nowadays internships are paid and it's heftily paid it's not even just a minimum wages like they really motivate and make the future out of it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's fantastic i don't think that's the case in the US DU brian'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i think there's some laws that i'd have to look there's it's state by state so i'm in texas so of course we have we're you know we're a right to work state where like not for workers rights so internships here can be unpaid and can be i mean they can be full time internships are unpaid that was gonna be the next question if you guys is does it depend if if it's a forty hour a week or you know it's showing you mentioned like you know people trying to do that while also working another job it's an internship where you only working twenty hours a week'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is that better to be i guess is that more acceptable to be unpaid versus if you're requiring somebody hey this is like a full time job essentially'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean internships are not just a job it's a learning phase for a student of or an individual so you know even employers cannot expect much from them so maybe that is one of the reasons why they prefer to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to you know have someone some interns who would like to be unpaid because they are not expecting too much from them they are just willing to have a new'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'employee with them and yeah the it's just like that i don't think it should be the case in every internships'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah because i i think there's there's there's definitely industries where i feel like if you made it illegal to have unpaid interns it would take a lot of opportunities away so just you know my my experience i'm in the sports industry it's a very competitive try to get in i didn't annotate internship you end up getting into learning a lot and getting into it and you know since you know i run a company and i have used unpaid interns'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so don't don't view me harshly for that but i've made sure that they're actually learning and there are opportunities like you know jenny said there are times where we have paid them they're doing an event and they they do a good job or if they you know they get a sponsor or if they get some sign up some like that they will get some pay but one thing i was bringing that up is because some of the universities will go to to get interns in their paperwork they'll have like the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the whoever 's gonna be the advisor for the intern actually sign something saying that they have to promise that the intern is that basically they're gonna spend more time teaching the intern then they're gonna get back and help so it's it can't be a net gain for the company so is there a way to you think to make that to to break that down and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'make it illegal to basically yeah you have somebody that's just doing grunt work and there's an intern versus you're spending more time teaching them than what you're getting and work they do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that just seems like it's it's i don't know how you would who would do that or how you would measure that or monitor that it just seems like it's an integrity thing that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it it would seem that it especially in this situation where there's more teaching involved it would just be mentoring and you know more idealistic altruistic kind of motivators as opposed to an extra set of hands you know doing things but i do think that the students there are you know they're being paid as i know we mean like financially but there are other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'gains that you get that you are being paid i would assume that you know you're unpaid interns you were writing them letters of recommendation or if you heard of an opportunity maybe not with your company but that you would so there are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'paid and unpaid as yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah there's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's there's there's a lot of benefits and yes i mean it i i think there's there's people that we can take advantage of it and i think that's why there's some states i'm sure some countries that have put in laws against it because if you're you know if you're a bigger company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'U M'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you have the money versus you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh in in you know the sole proprietor smaller LLC that's just getting off the ground it doesn't you can't afford it it's either it's either we have an intern we that person gets experience or we just don't have one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i really worry if making it illegal seems extreme and that interns would just they just would say it's not worth it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no i mean nowadays college is like i mean you mean even i also even i'm also from germany so nowadays some of the courses have like compulsory internship what i have seen like in india we don't have i actually i'm from india i've moved to germany for studies so in india we don't have something like compulsory internship but in germany i have seen courses where there is a compulsory internship so they have to come'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like mandatory for them to do to pass this to pass that semester so again again if the intent is getting paid or not it depends upon the company which is which is going to or and so as you said earlier like if the company is big it has a lot of fun so that it can give money and then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's it and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but it's not it's always just not about how much you get paid or what do you do in your job but who do you meet or what kind of network you're building in even if it's unpaid internship if it's worth it i mean if someone will ask me to do an unpin unpaid internship in the top notes company of my domain i'll do that because i know what value they will be adding in my profile what value they will be adding in my resume'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so it's it's up to me like i'm i need to learn from them and i need to make network out of it and you know letter of recommendation by the those individuals will be adding definitely value in my profile'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now again'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i accept with ishan to some extent and because the companies not not only the big companies even the small companies are recruiting interns by because the intern should go through a rigorous interview so if if if you're selecting an intern with such a process and you're not not giving him any pay it's like really bad i i feel really bad for the intern like he has gone through like so many rounds of interview then he got selected as an intern then finally he's like not getting paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even though the i mean of course the big companies would pay but i'm in general i'm saying in general'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but if you're a smart individual OK if i'll say like this if if you're a smart individual they will let you know as i said they will let you know what your job will be in your'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know when you will get hired what will be your job so just by knowing that it's up to you you should choose if you if this is the best fit for you or not so even if it's unpaid you should decide that if it's worth my time to do this unpaid internship or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of course yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm thinking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i was going to point out too like you know my my degree actually required an internship and i i see more and more degrees that are requiring internships like i i got so i got school credit so you can say i was unpaid and at the same thing with the with the interns i've gotten they might be unpaid but they get you know that's that's like twelve hours of college credit they're getting for doing the internship so i guess i mean in a way that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know if that makes it better'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's a payment yeah yeah so so in your internship did you have a resource at the college that say you were being overworked or maybe there was some treatment going on that wasn't right did you have somebody you could go to as a resource to get some feedback on how to handle things or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it there there is but they didn't do a good job because i even had friends who their internship he worked with i forgot what it is like the national senior games and worked sixty hour weeks'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh my god'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it that no you only had to do it for like half the summer and so the whole summer but yeah they they were working some long hours and nobody really cared like from seven AM to seven PM for like two three weeks straight at one point so yeah that there's definitely wasn't a lot of making sure things are actually happening right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah i can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and i'm assuming that your friend go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so yeah i was saying the same thing that we also have the same system here we also have to do mandatory internships which will add credit in our degree so yes ultimately it's us who will be deciding and it's not just if we know that what value we can you know get out of that company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'once we enter that company we will make networks we will learn something new and who knows that we can convert that internship into full time employment ship and that would not be unpaid for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we just have to take chance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and that's what earlier i talked about maybe it's it's different i i forgot about the college credit part but if somebody is in college versus not fighting credit i mean if that's kind of again that's kind of like a a payment versus just having somebody out there that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know it's finished to school and it's just getting nothing well if you still get the experience but getting nothing financially or on their books for it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah what i feel is like at least'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like uh we have like for internship there is no there is no advisory like there is no advisor from university related but for thesis they have an advisor from university like you have to like a professor should be in contact with the company then with the student so i feel that even for internships it should be like compulsory so that even universities should also control like what how many hours the student is working like even they should be a monitor like someone should monitor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so it would be good on student side also that's what i feel like they should be some rules or something like an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i just feel like the students young people are so i'm assuming it's primarily young people that are doing this and i feel like they're so vulnerable and i'm assuming like your friend that you said was yeah and your friend who was working sixty hours probably you know really wants to get into athletics and that was a great opportunity to make context and you don't want to burn bridges and you want to make a good impression so it makes you very vulnerable to people you know taking advantage of that eagerness'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i guess OK sorry here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they don't have choice'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah it it it i don't know how like going back to the original question and making it illegal it just seems so hard to actually enforce something to to go after the people are doing it wrong because i know and and and and not you know hating on the bigger companies i feel like in more often than not it would be those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bigger companies if they're not paying it's more they're taking advantage for us because they they have the money and then i feel like you know there's gonna be times where there's less responsibility versus a smaller one yeah you might have a big role like you know with when i've had interns that do events around the country and getting that experience and then we also i mean i guess another benefit flown in turns out to las vegas to new york so i'm great experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'versus if you just sitting in an office uh yeah just calculating excel sheets all day'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i've heard horror stories i can't think of any specifics but i my general perception is like new york city internships i just cringe you know i just that's my general'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a perception of what those must be like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as as janice said like integrity is like the very important part it it it's up to employers as well it's up to the company as well if they know that they will gonna get something out of that individual or intern they should pay them it's based on my personal experience during my internship interview they asked me about my salary expectation or skype and expectation so i just set the minimum wages but they knew that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what value i'll go going to be adding in the company so they offered me twice the amount which i said to them so it's yeah exactly it's it's it's up to them it's up to the integrity as well if they know that they should not hold back to offer more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's awesome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's nice'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and i think it two on the flip side you know you know you probably came in prepared and you know did a good job coming you know wanting to do a good job i think more and more now especially as it's internships are required there's more students college students going in and kind of putting in half effort'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and not doing a great job so you know if you're gonna require people to pay them then when they get kicked out of their internship halfway through and they they lose their college credit so i mean there there's definitely flip side'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly i mean they are not they are not they want someone who has experience like you know no one in the industry in the job market right now wanting someone you know fresher they want someone having minimum two years three years of whatsoever years of experience they are not offering internships which are paid so you know individuals students are not motivated enough to pursue an internship or even if they do they are not much valued and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it doesn't count as work experience and they end up being unemployed for longer time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but it's definitely yeah again tough to to to draw a line with the with everything but it is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is there are there any ideas of of something like for sure you think this should be illegal to not pay this type of work this type of position'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no i wouldn't i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as i said like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so as i said earlier as i said earlier so they should be certain set of rules which are which i mean i don't know if it's it should be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah sure go ahead try'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it should be created by government or should it be created by the university itself like to they should be someone who is monitoring the student what he's doing in the company how many hours is he working if he's working like like even a full time employee works like forty hours in a week but if the if the student the student is working for sixty hours it's like bonded labor like without even without without getting paid it's like so there should be they should be yeah they should be something like some rule some set of rules'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's it's a slavery'",

        "'speaker_1': 'so maybe more of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i strongly feel not receiving him'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe more of regulation than just making it outright illegal just having governments work to make sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whatever they need to do to make sure it's not exploited'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly like companies and companies and universities should have some sort of tie ups so even if a student failed to find internship by themselves like it's up to university it's their responsibility to offer a student and internship which should be paid and it's it should be you know regulated to an extent what amount should be paid to which kind of jobs what should be their roles'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and for which domain it should be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah thanks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i i'd say from personal experience there there's there have been a couple'",
        "'speaker_1': 'very very bad interns if they were getting paid they would have been gone after a week so and the the one positive of them getting a cash credit they the school kind of makes it hard to get rid of interns cause they don't wanna have to scramble to try to get them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know back into another internship you are paying for that those credit hours for your degree being in that quote unquote class even though no class so there has been a yeah it's just a really bad ones and it's like no you gotta go through like a three step process and all this to get rid of them so that is to you know that is there to help to make sure there's not just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and the more and the most i mean the worst part is you will get to know about the internship if it's paid or unpaid at the end of the interview at the end of the hiring process so it's it should be declared at very first so if someone has to back out they can back out before even the interview starts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'definitely even if you wait till the interview i mean that's still somebody investing their time and everything especially if it's in person interview then go in there and then finding out in the middle of the interview it's like well i just wasted my time coming here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly they will they will find they will interview ten more people and then they will hire you and then they will call you and say that OK it's unpaid internship do you still accept it or not i was like do i have a choice'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah even like the the dallas mavericks have had in unpaid interns and you're talking about you know team that's owned by a guy worth however many billion so that that i think in situations like that it's like yeah there's a huge demand so you can get people to work for free and it it will help them but you can't at least pay a minimum wage i mean come on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah your ethics are pretty shady if you're a billionaire and you can't pay a college student to come help one summer yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly hey sorry it's it's as i said like it's supply and demand kind of thing which also decide if the internship will be paid or should be paid or not because in tech jobs or finance job or medical jobs who has more social responsibilities those jobs i've seen they are usually paid and even if it's not paid the workload will be not that high or it would be remote job or internship like the person need do not need to go to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'no can it depends upon the like like if there are some good government like public public companies like research institutes where they pay less but the amount of the amount which you can learn is really high and there there are some private companies which pay really like'",
