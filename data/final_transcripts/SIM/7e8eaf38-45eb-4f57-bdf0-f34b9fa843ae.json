        "'speaker_4': 'ohh there's no sort of'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so who is in favor caravan you you're against it and anisha is also against assam is in favor so sam you go ahead make your initial statement please'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i mean i very strongly kind of support the fact that i think sport can play quite a vital role in terms of kind of personal development as as a child and talking from personal experience i've got two boys who are now eighteen and sixteen who both have played significant amount of sport both inside and outside of school and i think that's been quite instrumental quite key in terms of their development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i wouldn't say it's more important their education or anything like that but i think it it it can play a vital role in terms of developing a kind of well rounded individual so so yeah that would be my my kind of starting point as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would you like to counter it anisha caroline'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK i suppose i read say that whilst i can see that support might have some advantages i think there are other skills that are more key for life development such as gaining key literacy skills or Q you know key numeracy skills that help you do basic things such as adding up your shopping when you you know you know buying food in a supermarket as an adult and making sure you have you know necessary comprehension skills for documents we know when you're buying a house or signing up for a contract'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know for your utilities things like that so beneatha any thoughts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes so like sam and caroline said sports is obviously important but it is not as important as getting an education for personal development because first of all there are a lot of people with physical disabilities who will not be able to engage in supports and when it comes to teams sports there are a lot of scenarios where not everybody is athletically gifted to play sports there are a lot of people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who were not athletically gifted they may be academically gifted they may be picked on by certain you know call our athletic lifted the you'd call jogs or bullies who maybe it for being'",

        "'speaker_3': 'an odds are not maybe running faster or maybe not being sporty enough so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to sam what do you think about the playground pulling does it exist'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah well no i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i i think you can't deny that it exists but i wouldn't say that you you know i think there's a wider point here about doing sport it doesn't have to be an elite level it doesn't have to be at a high level and i'm just saying the act of actually playing sport with others can have significant benefits to individuals and can develop'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but do do do you see the drawback of sort of exposing your kids in that environment where it's like pretty physical and if your kid is not so let's say physically strong'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh or or gifted in certain spots and they would be bullied and it will give them mental scarring rather than developing them into a better'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure no i i expect that can be a potential issue but it's it's about finding the right level you know sports played a variety of different levels from you know boys that sorry boys and girls that are very gifted and playing at a very high level and to your kind of community level where you my view is you can find a suitable level for any child to play any sport that they want if if you're if you work hard enough to try and try and find that so i think the the key thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i suppose that's the the point i would wanna make here is that you know education is vital and education is very important but i think in terms of personal development i think sport enables you to develop certain skills and characteristics and abilities that potentially education in isolation may not enable you to do so so i think that's the key thing there's certain things such as kind of teamwork such as kind of dedication such as physical kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know involvement in activities actually you know running around and doing stuff and working hard at something and training at something and becoming better at something and kind of interacting with others outside of you know just the kind of classroom environment i think in can be very beneficial'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get a land do you think it's there there's a potential for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the sports to be detrimental in terms of the confidence of the kid because this systems that we have is like you're either a winner or a loser and if you're not physically sort of gifted you are essentially a loser for a lot of years in the school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i i just disagree with that i mean i i i have in my years ago i used to coach my one of my sons football teams and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know you know although there were some very good players there were other players that weren't as good whatever and it wasn't you know just depends on how you structure that environment you know it was clearly something that we established so that children could play football it wasn't just about having the best players or whatever else and i think of course there are very bad experiences that people have with sport and have very may have negative emotions with that but i think that's more to do with the way it's framed and the environment that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that that's kind of established for the for the children to play in so you know the point i'm trying to make is not inherently an issue of course there are bad circumstances and people have bad experiences but in terms of if we were able to provide a forum where children can play sport in a kind of safe environment and whatever else i'm just saying that the benefits from a personal development perspective are significant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whilst i think that's true i mean i have heard a lot of you know a lot of anecdotes about children 's clubs you know i thinking about some of the sports that i did as a child for example i know that gymnastics and dance there can be intensely competitive you know because these sports start start at a very young age you're looking at a three or four year olds they're can be an awful lot of competition and not only between the children themselves but it tends you know from what i hear and i've seen eggs exactly exactly you know ultra competitive mums and dads and i've heard that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'now i'm for i mean you know men and women are different and physically so it's sometimes you know it it's certain sports it's not fair that you know men women are competing you know the same level just because of those differences in terms of their physicality but there will be other sports where where you know the the physical differences are don't have an impact in terms of how they perform and in those situations yeah i don't see any issue with that whatsoever'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i don't know i think we've kind of digressed from the the kind of fundamental question here as to whether sport is good for children in terms of developing their you know in terms of personal development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that you know and i know we talked about elite sport and kind of you know sport where there's a lot of pressure from parents whatever else but there's also sport just just you know stuff that people do when they go down the park and they're kicking a ball around with their kind of you know friends and whatever else and as i say that it can be quite a social kind of opportunity for them there are children as well who do not thrive within an academic environment within an education forum and and then sport provides an outlet for them to'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yes but some people yeah so yeah children shouldn't be forced to play sports you know they could be encouraged to pursue other areas that they are good and you're gonna could be dancing or sticking or arts and crafts so i don't think it is a sport is specifically important to improve the personal development of children and they could perceive other things you know'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'where do you guys stand on the idea of removing this whole notion of winning and losing in sports and also in academia there is a conversation going on that we should lose that standardized testing do you think that that's an important element of the sports being able to go up with failure and losing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think you need to yeah i mean in in life everything in in reality everything is a competition so unfortunately you know when when you sit your exams you know you either pass or you fail you i i don't think you can remove that from sport to be'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no i was just literally talking about if if if sports would become a bigger part of childhood life that would mean we'd have to put more hours towards sports in the context of schooling this would mean fewer hours would be available you know for all the other you know lessons english math history science and geography et cetera so it's just a case of fitting it into the school day would be more difficult and if you rely on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but i mean all i'm saying is that someone who plays sport versus someone who doesn't play sport they will have an opportunity to develop personal skills and and certain characteristics that someone who doesn't play sport as they're growing up won't have had the opportunity to do and again i know you're talking about amateur leagues and professional leagues or whatever i'm talking about going down the park and kicking a football around or playing throwing playing cricket or whatever and it doesn't need to be structured in any kind of formal way i mean just the fact of doing something physical with'",

        "'speaker_1': 'with with your you know friends with with children your own age and and you know interacting with them in that way and that sort of environment we'll have a positive benefit on your on your personal development that that i think that's the point i'm making i'm not trying to say we should be formalizing it we should be pushing kids they should be training for hours and hours or whatever it's just the fact that they're doing something you know different something active what will benefit them in their future life'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i yeah no no no not at all parents should just accept the parents and the schools and the coaches should just accept that maybe your kid is not just athletic type you're not interested in sports so this should allow them to work on their strength so i personally i was very skinny and i was not at all athletically gifted so i was always the last one to be picked every time it was almost the pity time party time in the sense we all in india we have'",

        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but as i mentioned before there are some children growing up who who you know are dyslexic let's say so really struggle you know within within school and that environment and they they they have those same sensations when you know people are reading a book or whatever you know so as i say of course children are different people have different strengths there are certain things that certain people can do that others can't and whatever else but you know the fundamental question here is whether it's beneficial for a child to be playing sport at you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and at an early age in terms they're development and you know i'd make the case that yes definitely it is not for everyone but but yeah for the majority of people i think there's'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not denying there are certainly other ways that you can extracurricular you know activities that can benefit you in your personal development but just just being in the habit of actually doing some physical exercise on a regular basis has a positive impact on the individual'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just to push back on that if if you're talking about choice the kids would definitely choose using their phone and watching cartoons and all sorts of things he says so i i'm so they did there would be some sort of parenting decision to sort of encourage them or mightily force them to do certain activities'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i you know i i think you know we talked about teamwork we talked about you know i think one of the other benefits especially doing sport outside of school is there's a different kind of social group or a different set of people children that you get to interact with and i think that can always be helpful in terms of meeting others and kind of widening your social kind of groups and then as i say it's just that the physical aspect of doing some exercise and kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know kind of being able to expend energy in that in that positive way is also kind of beneficial so so that i think those would be the key points'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah no and i you know i think one of the problems we have though is that often the the choice of sports is quite is often very especially when you doing it through school or whatever else there's only you know one or two or three sports that you have exposure to whereas there are lots of different sports out there and potentially trying a variety of different sports you can find something that kind of suits you you know more so than others and i think that's'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so you're saying there's no inherently dangerous sport'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i think i think there are a lot of very dangerous sports but but you know the the people partaking in those sports do it consciously and actively knowing what the risks are so some yeah i think that's not something that are being forced to do as long as that's clear and wherever you can you have minimized those risks i i i think that's that's acceptable'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i literally with without a doubt i mean i used to really enjoy ice skating and i enjoy watching it now as an adult as well but there is no funding towards that sport so it has to be entirely funded by parents in effect you get other sports which receive loads of funding you know towards their you know the the national funding body so it's very variable if if there aren't those outreach programs then you know it's it's entirely down to how much disposable income of family has as to whether they can put their'",
