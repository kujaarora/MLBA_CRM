        "'speaker_4': 'the how to say good enough as a compensation for the for the kind of small kind of salary that's why i don't think that it has to be illegal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right i just still think that there are you know they're the people that don't not not that don't have to think about their expenses have a leg up in making internships a priority because there are a lot of people who can't just they can't invest all of their time in an internship and they might not be able to because they're they're really valuable internships that are full time you know they it's like work here full time and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'like why would i care if you married like let's say when you are eighteen or like seventeen because you have to calculate it like because you you know that no one 's almost no one would be interested in having a worker with zero experience like that's why you you have to calculate that OK like you have to analyze that yeah like when when i start to when will i start earning a decent money like what steps do i need to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's it's better we all agree that it's better when it's paid but as i said like it's also possible that unpaid work because there are a lot of students who are willing to have a job experience without caring about money so that's why as a company owner we have a lot of options there available and it's not unfair i will say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
