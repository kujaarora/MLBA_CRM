        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you mary'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you so much so uh today's topic is uh do you agree that companies shouldn't be allowed to look at future employees social media profiles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh let's kind of do who is for this who agrees and who disagrees'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i agree i no i disagree i think that employers should be able to look at the social profiles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK mary'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i am mixed but i would disagree and mainly say that employers should not be able to look at someone 's social media or less it is directly related to the project or to the employment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK that's a good one uh michael'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also somewhat mixed the thing is that what exactly are we talking about are we talking about a company looking at your public profile that anybody can look at anyway like whenever i make a job application people look at my linkedin profile and that's why i set it up the way that i set it up i mean i think a company should be able to look at whatever is public cause anybody can look at that but the question really is should a company be able'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to make you share everything that's on your profile'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think the only way they'd be able to do that is if well there's a couple of different social medias right everyone there's a linkedin there's facebook there's instagram etcetera but i think that like in some instances employees employers will ask you share your linkedin profile they may might check you out that way to see your connections and networking but then there's the other thing where they might check out your facebook so we can stick to those kinds of social media things but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but the the the the the thing is anybody that looks me up on facebook will see a nice video by carl sagan about the pale blue dot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and nothing and nothing else'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if they if they think that you fit in with their culture or something then they might think that that is a good thing but what are some of the mary since you're against this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you think that cause this is about prior like a you know potential candidates what do you think expand on that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm yeah so i think because the way social media is these days a lot of people use it for marketing strategies and purposes they might have their own businesses or they might even be involved in some other personal junctures or ventures that they would not like their employer to know so i think that again it is essential to maybe first get the future employees permission'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to be able to gain access to their social media and again make sure that it is relevant to the future position for instance if someone is being hired as a social media content strategist it would be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so look at their social media but if it does not require the employer to do so i don't believe it is necessary'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on the other hand this could be a public safety issue or safety of the already existing employees of the company or the ones yet to be hired if you look at someone 's social media especially on a facebook page and you figure out pretty easily that this guy 's a sociopath'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that might be a kind of an important issue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yeah i i think it's an important issue to be able to see because we do have drug tests and we have other tests when you go into a job but many employers want it you go into your interview and your interviewed him you put on your best face and employers want somebody who's gonna stick around and if they go on to a facebook page and they see you know you drinking in it or using drugs or whatever i as a as a if i was a business owner i wouldn't wanna hire them and i do think it's important to see some of that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'social media like what are you putting out there what kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah or or or yeah or or or or there is a guy in his mid twenties always showing off guns'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is it negative or is it positive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",

        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the thing company culture makes a big difference'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes i know who you're you know what job you're looking for but i'm a big advocate of i'm a teacher actually but i and i do tell my students you don't put anything on there they still do it of course but you don't put anything out there that and i'm also older so i didn't have that growing up so i don't know how mary you might be younger so it's such a part of the younger generation there whole you know it's it's just everybody has it every business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this that i just think that if if i'm hiring somebody i wanna know about them and what they're putting out there because i don't wanna hire somebody and then i and then i find out they've been bashing every every other employer they've worked for on facebook or instagram or what have you that's one reason and the other yes yes because we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'troublemaker'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean the the that that's one of the things that keeps amazing me anyway how particularly the younger generations seem to have no clue how to use all the tools they've been given and how to use even basic privacy settings on something like facebook'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's astonishing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but uh mary'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you and i can sort of or you can agree that it's like it's sort of interesting because there's a mix there's a some people use it for marketing like you said sometimes it's basically their CVV or their resume online even facebook they might use it for different reasons to communicate and connect with people like employee employers or something networking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so some people use it for that other people don't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i can respect that mary like i just wanna say that one of the things that you don't want is they're them checking on you to see if you have kids especially as a woman because then you you're more difficult hire cause that's against the law to you know not hire somebody if they have kids etcetera so i definitely respect the privacy piece if it is you know the question like i think michael said or mary said if if if it's open to the public anyways'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i think that they should know about privacy settings right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i i'm assuming when the i assumed under the question was that it would be open it it would be what was open for anybody to because one thing i know and i had an employer teach my students is is if you just type in somebody 's email address you can go to their facebook page so it's very easy to access if it's not private'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which is one of the reasons why you should always have a number of different email addresses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i also know that too the way that i'm working these days is involved you know it might not necessarily be the thing with age of a participant or employee it might just be to how advanced their future employer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah maybe you know they're working processes maybe if it's more so online versus a hybrid or in person scenario it really all depends on several factors because i would say that i'm not necessarily part of the new versus the old generation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're right in between so i see all changes in the differences that you know my parents generation and the generation before them what it meant to be successful in the united states and just in general and what it meant to also be respectful on the job a lot of those social are changing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep yeah actually one of the things one of the things that was mentioned'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'was not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'allowing discrimination like on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the basis of gender but what i'm finding is i've been looking for a new job now for a while'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people love my resume people love that are passed all the different tests but then they look at my data birth and they look at ohh damn this guy is about sixty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't want to hire him'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you have to give your data birth so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean that that that that's the thing when when you embellish on a resume embellishing on your age stops the minute you have to also provide a copy of your passport'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah a lot of those discriminations at the workplace are reasons why people to either hide their social media or put some type of password protection so that folks who are out in the ethernet or metaverse do not have easy access to their profiles so yeah i think it definitely has to do with you know what was mentioned before stigma of potentially using substances or drugs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know on your instagram or other misnomer behaviors that again might or might not be relevant to your job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah or or or say that you have a hobby that might be considered dangerous and you're applying for a slow called key personnel position and then they look at your profile and they see you love racing cars'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you might get killed and your weekend'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right and then again that has to do with life insurance right is your is your employer willing to provide device insurance due to your extracurricular activities or not so i think that conversation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'liability'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes liability is also concerned so a lot of those things will come into place as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if you're right uh the protected attributes of sex gender the construct of race or ethnicity all those things i think that HR cause is thirty works ichnology so those are some things we're still implementing different'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh things to mitigate those kinds of biases but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i mean an employer that that would be a concern i guess on one hand are they using it to be discriminatory or something towards a candidate that is not allowed that's probably against'",
        "'speaker_1': 'work laws in the US and stuff like that so that's really important to think about but i think that for example why you used to work at apple and they gave a you can't even say where you were working really and you couldn't discuss any business process so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is you're right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know uh that's the kind of thing that i'm concerned with on my end but that would be once you're working but a potential candidate yeah i had some fears because i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i just it's a sort of a paranoid paranoid feeling'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean that that's where that's where the whole thing comes in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are we talking about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a company being able to look at what anyone can look at or are we talking about a company being able to force you to give them access to pretty much everything and like on my facebook page for example'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are certain things that i only give very few people specifically access to like if i happen to be in new relationship that's none of the business of an ex of mine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and she will not be able to see that while some other people will be able to see that and the public certainly not at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i think if we go back to company culture too i i would like because i know that you said that the your moderator you said that the company culture i think four company to look at somebody ahead of time and find out if they think they're a good fit you know before hiring them that's not a bad idea either it because you can see a lot by a profile as long as it's open to the public'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because then they could if there's concerns you could either clarify them or know and they don't want to waste their time hiring and training somebody when they can find something out by looking at their social media so i do think there's pros to it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm let alone dust'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so cost'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct correct not just getting rid of people but the people that they wanna keep correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cost to hire'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean if if you seriously want to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'put somebody under the microscope you can do it the way that the US department of state does it i've done a series of interviews for jobs at embassies in berlin frankfurt and dusseldorf i mean these guys first of all they do a language test make sure you speak the local language you speak english'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then the test you in excel the test you in word the test you on windows all of that supervised and then you get into the first and second stage interviews and you're confronted not by one person interviewing you but anywhere from three to five'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'channel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a panel and one of them i can guarantee you is the CIA dude'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh well yeah they're that happens in the US too but for different jobs look go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the CEO is sometimes present during a interviews'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that's a more personable approach because it gives people a chance to meet the future employee from different perspectives and to be able to be engaged you know with them beyond their social media right it's work real world engagement you get to see if this person has an actual great personality if they would be a good team member if they would complete task like they said they would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all of those things that you can't necessarily tell just by looking at someone 's profile right it's kind of similar to for instance like the dating world or dating apps right you can only look at someones profile but you can't really say really until you meet them until you talk to them and until you get to know who they are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'well plus plus you don't know how doctored all those photos are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well let's just stick to the works like it says sorry two at work stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK because that was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is making me think there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah no but uh OK well let's uh compare some people can be one way then on social media than they are in their real world but you know as far as your CV resume'",
        "'speaker_2': 'jobs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the only thing that i can think of that may'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be beneficial there would be a kind of checking out is this person really in the wherever they say they are does it seem like they made up a bunch of stuff as it catch me if you can stuff like that i mean that's one thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah on on on on the on the other hand you have things like one of the problems i run into being a little bit on the older side is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i specifically tailor my resume to my potential future employer because if i put everything i've done into my resume people instantly think i'm nuts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because because i mean from owning restaurants to nightclubs to being a real estate broker to being a contractor to being a translator to being a taxi driver in airport shuttle driver and so on the list goes if i put'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would that go under your entrepreneurial or something else'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'most mostly entrepreneurial and the thing is that if i put everything in if if i put everything into my resume people think that i'm george santos'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that's least you've practiced a lot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'only i'm not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know yeah a lot of people that what they put on on there to tailor it towards the the employer the job description if you will skills that are transferable or relevant work recent work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the job yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stuff like that but uh let me get a quick estimate uh mary do you think that uh how deep do you think that the hiring or hiring manager recruiter what is your feeling about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how they do a search for on a potential candidate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i'm not sure how they do a search these days but i know linkedin is a great resource that people use that is considered social media but more so for the workplace so there you're able to put maybe even some like personalized things like if you go on a hike over the weekend or you know something that an employer could see and not base like discrimination based off of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know i think that's a good place for people to put up whatever they would want and future employer to see so yeah it all it really just all depends on again to what the social like which social media platform is being used because if it's like tick tock for instance versus instagram versus facebook'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh my gosh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then yeah there's no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in so many uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a good point on that one i think people should look at potential employers should look at tick tocks because there's even doctors doing saying some crazy stuff like dentists doctors people that we had trust our health too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we gotta check those people out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now tick tock that tick tock there you got something that i definitely am too old for however there is one other consideration that let let let's say you have given a potential employer deeper access than what the public gets on your social media profile how about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's fun'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it sounds like a headache'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'protection of that data living in germany again now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what happens'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people here have their data protected in a number of ways and far better than in the US'",
        "'speaker_4': 'after an employer looks at your stuff decides he doesn't want to hire you who can he share that information with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's true too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'data companies the big companies because everyone mostly it's the data companies that receive a lot of revenue from all of our information online everywhere so that's what it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and and and and and and can that employer then share information with faith with with google and others that didn't have that information about me before'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they probably do but they will be able to especially uh you know that do not sell my information that has to be on their on some things that's one way to prevent people making money off of it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on on on on on on one line of the disclosure that is fifty eight pages long that i need to click on within five seconds'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well that's that's the freedom google gives us of course thank google but go ahead may or mary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just i guess i had a question more like well one of the reasons i think that maybe employers want access is to if they hire you can they dictate what you put up there and what you don't cause'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they can i've seen and like i said apple is one of them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they told you what you could and you couldn't put up and i think like as a teacher i've seen an education we've been told directly not to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have conversations on facebook or or these other things with students and it makes sense because of all the accusations and all the innuendo that can come into play in any kind of social media because you know people misread how many things that are put up there or not put up there so i guess part of me wonders like is part of the reason that that they an employer wants to look at your your social media is to just to say what you need to stop doing that could be a reason too and i'm all for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right it does'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess to some extent i mean if if you're liberties are invaded but as an apple worker i can see i guess you could see why they did it they don't want their information'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not necessarily if it's for like a tech it's something more along the lines of i'm not going to give you any one my business process or any tech secret that we weren't even privy to this tech secret it's probably a google search anyway but yeah they used to be those like just a few years ago like three four years ago but they that was things have changed and things moved quickly so they're being a little more transparent but no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not now mary that prohibition for a teacher to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'discuss things online with the student i mean i understand that and it makes sense for your personal account but does that also apply specifically to discussion groups'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh no no that's a great question no we have we definitely have to discuss we have school email and we have well when we have canvas so sometimes we have classrooms where you actually have a meat so no that's not the same thing you're you're right but on a private way it got some people in big trouble'",
        "'speaker_4': 'outside of your own account'",
        "'speaker_4': 'god that's good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i wouldn't want to talk to any of my students i would just be like you're in and you're out go beef fruitful beef prosperous'",
