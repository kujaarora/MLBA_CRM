        "'speaker_1': 'uh and hire people based on their appearance gives examples high end retail stores bars restaurants airlines so uh yeah we wanna have a good discussion back and forth reminder everyone needs to speak at least six minutes don't worry too much about cutting people off that's what we're looking forward to be just be nice about it or you do it but to get started i want everybody to do an audio check say your name and then say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my name is melinda the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK sounds good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'my name 's ankur the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lily are you still there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lily not sure if you can hear me but you are muted if if you can hear us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let me try to send her a message lily if you are there let us know so we can go forward with this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi sorry my internet i think just bouncing it out'",

        "'speaker_4': 'hi my name is lily and the quick brown fox jumps over the what the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes that's good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all right guys so we will jump into it as far as you know the question is it OK for companies to hire people based on their appearance uh do we have anybody that is is for this it says yes it is OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm for it umm when the industry is based on looks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK any anybody it's against it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say i'm i wouldn't be against it i would be neutral or four'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah not against it either but it depends on the degree of exclusion that we are talking about we like outrightly saying that if you have got any kind of visible marks you're automatically disqualified for even applying or are we saying that distinguishable mugs unappealing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stands out and probably not suited for the front desk so is is the degree of exclusion in my opinion that counts not just announced'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with that totally'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so where where would you guys draw the line on that is it i mean obviously there's some industries where yes it is it is kind of you might be the face of the business almost is it that we just don't want people discriminate yeah if somebody has a scar or something like that or what do you think the line should be drawn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that if the if the industry is based on like say you work for a plastic surgeon or you work for hooters or a place like that then you know based on links is obvious because that's the business model but if you're just in an office or you know just a regular job that isn't based on lugs then there shouldn't be any discrimination at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but we're talking about retail stores here correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it it gave examples of high end retail stores bars restaurants airlines etcetera so i think it's it's across the board i mean obviously gives some examples like bars restaurants and high end retail stores where yeah appearance might might matter depending on those type of places'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly so i feel like in in a lot of those stores and no matter what what they try to sell to you appearance obviously plays a pretty big role because there has been various studies that just show that a more attractive person it seems more approachable might make the customer more likely to buy the product so i obviously understand that businesses would like to hire more attractive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'retail personnel but on the other hand obviously you can't discriminate but there is no discrimination laws against hiring attractive people as long as it doesn't go into some sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a more strict bias let's say because what is beauty what is attractiveness how do you decide that it's obviously very subjective'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's an interesting segue because it's the question says that's based on appearance that does not specifically talk about beauty what about all the fashion people who have got tattoos for example or people who have got differentiated hairstyle or body piercings or things like that which which make counters as attractive in in in someones definition may not count as attractive in somebody else 's definition'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if if would i be bothered if i walked into high end retail store uh with with somebody with with facial tattoos probably talk to me myself not but probably somebody else might depends on the clientele depends on the on the maybe on the age group as well if you're trying to i'm not in not discriminating based on age but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the is just human nature to expect a certain age group not to be comfortable with with alternate fashions like like somebody showing up with purple hair for example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that that's that's that's still appearance the according to this question but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah no of course yeah yeah that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and then there's a lot of companies that have guidelines you know you can't have visible tattoos or you can't have you know unnatural hair color so that that's definitely you know i think a hundred percent acceptable to me you know of course and we get into you know if if somebody 's yeah depending if if they are good looking or not or if they have you know want somebody that has blonde hair instead of black for instance i mean that's that's what i think when it gets into the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'kind of that gray area you know what is OK to do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know my my my opinion would be if the appearance of the person regardless of how the establishment field is actually not driving away business'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh it and it's there's actually no commercial reason or economic reason why this person should be excluded'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it should not be a factor at all towards their employment if somebody showing up with blue hair and and body piercing all facial tattoos is not bothering or not in any way shape or form driving away customers or driving away business from that establishment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there should not be any reason why that person should not be employable in in that certain type of establishment so it shouldn't be the management cutting the cutting the drawing the line in the sand and saying hey you have to look this particular way to find a job to be employed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i mean fifty years ago that would be unacceptable why should it be acceptable now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'very things have changed so much and people are beginning to be more individualistic and i think it's good that people are allowing other people to have tattoos to be employed and think and think we're working towards you know taking steps towards the right direction to where everybody doesn't have to be completely cookie cutter and looking the same and you know conforming with their own personal way that they present themselves to be able to be employed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah well the funny thing is that it in in some places now you might be you might your parents might be too boring and they won't hire you they want somebody with tattoos and piercings you know sort of it's a bar restaurant that might be you know more trendy and fit their style'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and even even the more high end retail stores i'm seeing more and more'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and in in my hometown for example there is now a a it's a store that that has very many high end brands like gucci prada armas whatever and they a few years ago hired a a very attractive man but he has a lot of tattoos and he shows them very visibly but it seems to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not only maybe about what the what the body like i'd say what the body looks like if it has the tools or piercings or whatever but he is obviously a very well dressed man so there is obviously also a component of like dress code cleanliness etcetera that maybe if a person with tattoos who is rather unkempt wouldn't be hired but someone who has tattoos but is a stylish person might still be hired by high end fashion store'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if a company maybe not only focuses on the appearance of the body but has like relatively strict dress codes and and like let's say personal hygiene dress codes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then i could see that many people would still fit fit that description even even if they have piercings or or whatever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'potential employees already know that appearance matters but what what do you guys think if i mean if a company is just straight up and straight forward with it and they're listing and say we will only hire'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good looking people for this position do you think that is OK you think it's better to be upfront about it or or what what do you think about that situation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's better to be upfront with it i mean so you know what you're walking into and i think that you know if it matches their business model then that's OK because that's what they're making their money based off of you know like like i said like the the cosmetic surgery offices or the people that you try to sell it or you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'restaurants and bars like hooters and places like that you know if they're they are selling a attraction they are selling a way a person looks so i think that's totally fine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i'm kind of going to second that if the business of the establishment is selling an image and through that service'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh like hooters for example or or any other establishment which prescribes a particular look or appearance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's acceptable as long as that job is for that client facing or the customer facing role and not just applies blankets saying that hey it doesn't matter if you are facing the customers or not if you're working in the back somewhere doesn't matter if you're in the corporate office you have to look this particular way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because that would cross the line into discrimination then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but then there's obviously right there's obviously that line so you can say you have to look attractive but you obviously can't really become much more specific with that because as soon as you go into let's say young skinny white whatever the beauty standard is that people look for exactly that would go into discrimination and i know that a few years ago abercrombie and fitch had had a big lawsuit about that they were hiring the all american image or whatever they called it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's discrimination'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think i saw a documentary on that actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah when it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they ended up settling for like fifty million dollars so obviously there was some sort of discrimination in that in that progress in that process'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and i mean race is technically a fairness in appearance it might be a company only once yeah person that's as of a certain skin tone so obviously that would go against discrimination i think that's that's where you definitely need to draw a line but some of the other things you mentioned like i don't think i mean i'm sure there can be lawsuits but if if they said and obviously like places like hooters are not hiring obese waitresses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so i'm like curious what you guys thoughts on things like that if they do say you know you have to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you have to be skinny you have to be fit is that is that OK so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i guess i at hooters i guess it's a mix of a a waitress or a waiter and and a half model so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would never find it hard to argue against that because that is their business model and any other position like i'd say abercrombie and fitch where it's supposed to be just a a a staff a a retail worker and it's kind of hard to say that an obese person wouldn't be able to work there and also considering that obesity is considered a disability'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at least in the united states and does seems like you wouldn't be able to discriminate against that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would say let let the again i would put the business decide or or rather the economy decide how how their customers react to it if a body body positive image is boon for that establishment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there there should be nothing that should be holding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh somebody who is plus sized to get employed remember a few years ago uh it how everybody reacted when plus size model started working on these all these high end fashion shows and everybody was all years about how inclusive it is it can be a very powerful marketing tool if you know what your clientele is if you are in an area where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know where where obesity is just just the way of life i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm not sure whether that place would be but just hypothetically if obesity is a way of life uh and and uh supporting a plus size server for example may gets you more seats in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know gets more butts in the seats and then then yeah the golfer it it could be a marketing tool as well just like i really doubt all these people who were promoting plus size models in in in the berlin fashion shows and et cetera and so on and so forth were actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about the cause versus getting cheap marketing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh of course yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'marketing yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this could be a marketing tool for these businesses as well it depends on how where they were client tells draw the line'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah well there's stores like cato and a few others that are just plus size stores and i feel like if i were a plus size person going into a plus size store and there was a sales associate there that was just ultra thin i would feel uncomfortable because i'm going to try to find clothes that would fit me i would want to be represented by someone that looked like me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i was going to bring that up exactly that point is it is it yeah is it is it OK for them to ask for only only obese people or bigger people exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then could they say no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and those skinny people apply'",
        "'speaker_3': 'interesting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's that's a different way of looking at it then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh it's the it's the same it's just a different way of appearance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's appearance doesn't necessarily mean attractiveness exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'an interesting thing i recently read you know phil knight 's book about starting nike and the E talked about himself it was was in good shape but the rest of the people have started nike were like one was in a wheelchair one was like more belly obese and another was like he was obese as well so it's it's it's kind of funny that a you know athletic company athletic shoe company was one of their their founders and their important people we're not athletic but i don't know if they would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the thing about that is i don't think they would hire anybody that's not fit today at at a company like that cause they they're more about their image and especially now with social media i mean i think that's a factor as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah image cells'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but so what's what industries do you think i guess we we're trying to define that line that it makes sense that for goes from making sense to alright that just doesn't matter if there is bias or if somebody 's hiring a better looking accountant where you guys be against that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they're not interacting with the customers and the business model is not based on looks like strippers for instance that's based on lugs but if you're an accountant in the back that shouldn't be based on looks i mean you're not you're there to do an intellectual job not a service job that has to do with looks and if you're only in tiring attractive people for like back office jobs i would be concerned that there was an element of you know maybe sexual harassment going on in that area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm but yeah if it's part of if it's part of your image and part of what you're selling then that's OK but i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you if you are able to if you are able to classify a appearance as skills needed for the job and categorically skills needed for the job and not not like how little but it it's not a like a like a window into sexual harassment per se then yeah it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh that's obviously'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's probably OK because it's that it's skills for the job not not just for every role and not for every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a great way to say it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what one of the examples given here is airlines so obviously the flight attendants stewardess whatever you want to call them i think they do tend to want to get better looking individuals and that i think also i mean there's maybe there's a there's something there too about you don't want somebody that is too obese because you're on a plane they're gonna be going down the aisles and squeezing by people but you think that is still fine and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of industry like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i feel like that's it's parts of that are are more questionable i mean obviously you can't have a morbidly obese person a squeezing through the aisles because it's gonna be very uncomfortable for them and for the for the people who are flying and so i feel like they're that might make sense and stewardess is also generally have a high minimum'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and which obviously also kind of goes into the appearance category but there it also is because i need to reach certain things that need to be able to open up the head compartments etcetera so those things i feel like are not not an issue because they are functional you need to be that high to be able to reach certain things and you need to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'let's say not not morbidly obese to be able to squeeze through the the aisles and easily'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah to be able to take might go into not be enough to do your job effectively if if you are too too much of a wait'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly but then the attractiveness part doesn't really affect their work obviously directly but then again airlines always have had that image since the commercial flying was really really became common and the stewardesses are supposed to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pretty and young but obviously if you are hiring currently'",
        "'speaker_4': 'only looking for young people that would be discrimination based on age but still i feel like most airlines would wanna go for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and so the question is do they put that in their job description i would think probably not will they hire based on that probably yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah how how old you i know you can't ask we can't i guess you can't yeah specify an age i don't think you can also you know say you need to be younger looking but no i think i think with airlines it's definitely i i would bet if you did a study on it men would say that better flying experiences when there are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i totally'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'attractive female stewardess versus older or males and so that that could that could be a business you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh a profitable thing going for that so i guess there there was yeah the decision is that OK for them to try to do that or how they they go about that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm iffy on this one i don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know it's so it's difficult and you know there's just so many different factors i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think that that one might be like the one that's on the on the border there it's like OK so it does play a factor i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there might be people yeah i'm gonna go on delta instead of spirit because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the is just maybe it's more vibrant people they just you know whatever it's looking younger it's looking better or it's just whatever the case is that might affect their business so yeah that that might be a factor as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh quite honestly how many how many flyers are actually going to make a decision about a ticket price based on how attractive i'm just balling here but how attractive they find the flying through of a particular airline maybe if it's here to hear decision that might factor in but and and to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but otherwise it's it's not a it's not a decision based on which everybody's going to make us make the choice is the root available'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't think consciously'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah at least not consciously of consciously maybe but then again i kind of yeah going back to what lily said if if it's if it's a hike thing because you have to reach overhead compartments or you can't be morbidly obese of because due to maneuverability for example then those things then that is a practical decision that is skills for the job again but if the airline says hey you have to be size zero between'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'subconsciously maybe a little bit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'five foot five and six feet five have to have blonde hair blue eyes white skin now that's that's going far beyond just fitment that's that's no longer there's no practical use for those attributes to be considered'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no of course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right that's discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but so can they search for attractive people specifically'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can they put in there you have to be attractive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think companies actually go put that in a different word words for example i like i for example i'm a student right now but i've been looking at these advertisements and i occasionally come across advertisements for roles in marketing for example where they would say in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh in with the trend or in with in with how how how our customers buy now why do you need that for marketing analysts who is sitting in the backroom i don't understand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but yeah that's that's subtle way of putting that thing that this is the this is how we want our people to look as pretty legal in in europe but yeah if anybody wants to pursue that line'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but i i mean for a marketing team i kind of understand that they would want people to understand the young folk or whatever whoever you're trying to mark market too obviously makes sense that if you are within that group maybe you understand better how to market to that group'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yet'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that doesn't mean you have to look'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and beautiful in whatever sense or or attractive number whatever sense it is but it might mean that they want someone who is within that age range or at least understands that culture'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which i feel like maybe is reasonable'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that i think that's reasonable reasonable because that would be an attribute needed for that particular job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly yeah you need to understand the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh these these are number crunching jobs that i'm talking about uh back office roles but yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh OK you're not doing the marketing you would be analyzing things'",
