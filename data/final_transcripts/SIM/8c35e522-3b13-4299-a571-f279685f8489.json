        "'speaker_1': 'it was just so you know OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh OK so so i think rather engineer were first so shrader engineer where application would advocate for unpaid internships and she's an i for that it shouldn't be legal OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'shiny'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK awesome so who would like to start'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would like to start off so should i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so i feel these days it's very rare that a company wants to offer you a good job without any prior experience the job market is very competitive and it can be very tough for recent graduates like me to get a good job offer as companies demand good skills and at least a little bit of hands on experience and i feel internships offer you type internships provide you with practical experience for beginners and occupation or profession so i feel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'military factor shouldn't pay the primary primary focus or rather monetary stuff shouldn't be weighed on much considering the other important benefits that the internship is offering you which can very much help you to supersede other candidates while applying for a real job after your graduation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree i think they're having the prior experience in the field or area of expertise is something that most employers are looking for and to make it illegal with discourage corporations and companies and entities from providing those opportunities to new graduates or individuals who might be changing their careers you know you might have not have experience in something so it it became illegal then there will be fewer opportunities out there for people to get experience hands on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and mentorship that's a really important factor networking because after you finish this internship you could possibly get not only a job there but you may come in contact with individuals who have other leads and so creating an environment where it's illegal would discourage that the opportunity and make it so much harder for the workforce to find employment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'unpaid internship are unfair to poorer pupil and this should be stopped'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i know it is legal but it should be stopped unpaid interns are feel less motivated towards work and it can give a company a bad reputation because when we do an internship we are facials and we want to to we want to pay our expenses also so we should be paid and and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'unpaid internship only allowed in an australia all over the world internship should be paid because youngster consider internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as courier starting and unpaid internship are unjust because they can create an a level playing field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i i just i disagree because just because there is no monetary gain for the internee they are benefiting by having those skills honing skills learning new things apply being they can put you can even put an internship on your resume and there are companies that look for that so in the US which is my context you as long as the the primary beneficiary of the internship is the internee and not the company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because if if if the company is benefiting more from having the intern there than the intern is benefiting from being there then they have to be classified as an employee and they have to be paid but the the knowledge the skill set the environment and the and then sometimes there's a cost to the company to even have the intern there they're getting access to passwords they may have to have safety equipment you know give them an office things of that nature insurance they might have to be insured while they're on the premises and these things cost the company money so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know the in essence the the internet is being paid they're just not getting paid in a salary or an hourly you know compensation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i absolutely agree with that channel and also a question for sissa like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a there are mostly there are these students who opt for internship and if they have enrolled for a full time course into any university or any college as far as i know it requires them to complete the seventy five percent of attendance clause so i have a question here like you said they should be given it paid internship to pay off their debts or educational loans or whatever they have so my question is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they are attending a full time college or full-time universities how will they manage with the internship stuff because as far as i know it's called as mini jobs which mostly students opt for up to their college hours or after their university hours which pays'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'also that you mentioned it's voluntary most cases in internship as as a student or a potential employee knows that they're not going to be paid right they're consent they consent to come and glean and gain and learn and be exposed and experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with that being paid they they automatically know what they're going into and then i know that i realized that sometimes it's not just because you agree to something doesn't make it legal or ethical i agree but i like the premise that the the i think is the department of labor in the US takes with they they actually do an audit you have to determine who is the who's getting the most out of this deal and if you answer these particular question i think it's a seven point survey if you if the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the determinant the determination is that the internee is more of like just hard labor and they're getting taken advantage of then legally they cannot participate in the internship but people know what they're getting into when they're doing an internship wouldn't you agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no i'm this is because it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'she's up perhaps yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because in india colleges two types soul and regular and soul student can do internship and regular and regular student don't go college daily'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so student can fulfill their dreams and internship are just different types of internship we can get them sometime internship is full-time part-time or two three hours work and after loud down we can see a work from home opportunity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so then what so it would be more of a regulating the number of hours or time instead of making it illegal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so when when we get our wifi'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so we should be better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so wouldn't you agree that it would make more sense than to regulate the number of hours or amount of time instead of making it illegal you say you set parameters and say OK well you know you cannot have an intern working more than a certain number of hours or it may be in certain capacities so that they are not being taken advantage of are are you referring more to fellowships and residencies because those are paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our resources our our resources regarding internship is broader so we should be paid we can pay our wifi bills we can choose a best laptop or a mobile phone we can give our precious time we can so we should be paid i thought according to me we should be paid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i absolutely uh disagree with this because we aren't giving up precious time for free right we are gaining something in return we are gaining the exposure to corporate environment we are gaining a valid certificate after our internship which is counted as a valid experience when we of for any job opportunities and as far as i know i am an indian of course and i did three degrees in which i had to do in mandatory internship during my college'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but in the last semester our second last semester so you know it was still a win win situation for me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you are in college for the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't do anything yeah i am a student and i did an unpaid internship or other internships during my college hours so i feel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK internship doesn't quite guarantee of a job where internship period is over you have to find another job or internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes but we have the option and the opportunity potentially to work where you did your internship most places that offer internship well i won't say most i don't know if that's statistically correct or accurate but i would say in my experience with because i am i have my doctorate degree and i had to do internships you have opportunities throughout the course of your education or post education to be offered jobs in so many cases by the places where you go to do the internship so i think the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the benefit that you're gaining'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it should it it it balances out as far as compensation is concerned because even if you don't get a job at that particular company you now have that skill set you can add those qualifications and skills to your resume as well as the length of time on your resume of how long you did the internship because that adds and is considered as previous experience as shadra mentioned many companies want you to have hands on you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'experience doing whatever it is that you're applying for and so again i state making that practice illegal really lessens the opportunities for so many people in the workforce who need as many opportunities as possible especially with inflation going on it's so much harder to find jobs as it is taking away one particular component of preparation for that job because let's say it's illegal and so you don't you don't have the opportunities to do internships'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as as it were they have to be paid so again like i was saying if you were companies are going to be able to do it because not everybody can afford to pay their interns and then the the job pool and the job market is significantly infected infected affected because they're not that many people who can apply for the jobs out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but how do you how do you how do you deal with the with the companies that there are kinda abusing that system so so so perhaps a company doesn't need more truly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'qualified workers but but they need workers who who just gonna do the i don't know the the the easy tasks but but there is still need to be done and they abuse the internship system by by hiring interns that are not getting paid but are doing those tasks for them so how do you deal with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think uh government regulation the US department of labor as i was speaking of before has certain restrictions and parameters the number of hours someone can work the type of environment that they can work in so you could not have an intern working like an on construction site operating certain kind of machinery or what have you if they have not done an apprenticeship and they've done that in a controlled environment you know so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the UM i i think i guess regulating what exactly the intern can do when where and for how many hours and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and and forcing that by maybe not allowing any tax incentives you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any any kind of benefits that the company would gain would be affected or they could be punished through some kind of remuneration if they do not abide by those guidelines that are set for their internship programs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and also before choosing your internship it's very well mentioned in the job description if the internship is legit and the company is good so it's very well mentioned in the job description like what your responsibilities would be and what you will be doing in that particular role and also we signed the internship contract before joining in right so we do have a legal side or legal proof of what we were supposed to do and what the companies making us do so we can always take a stand on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but sometimes there are so many frauds regarding internship or job positions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what can you say about shraddha'",
        "'speaker_3': 'say that again please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can always verify before joining it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my internship and the positions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'enter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people can say you have to pay this much amount and you will get an internship or full-time or best internship you will get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would rather do online courses than if i have to pay i ain't doing that but again there are many options where you can go for good legit companies rather than going for such scams where you yourself have to pay to the company to hire you as an intern'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you are have no idea about the social steps what were you doing then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you can you repeat'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can you repeat i couldn't hear you properly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i said there is so many fraud regarding job and internship we are fresh and we have no experience regarding a full step regarding get untouchable interview what we can should be an interview what we don't should interview'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah i feel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it was my college who took a front state where they educated us on how to check if the company is legit and if they're offering you a good deal so i feel that's totally up to us if you could go a bit into detail check the registration check if the company is really good and if it's really registered and checked the reviews on glassdoor you can always have that option where previous employees are ex employees have mentioned their reviews if the work culture is good if the company is good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they treat their employees good so these are some factors which you should consider even while choosing an internship and not just your job which can again save you from the frauds and scams that are happening in the market'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly i think i think that it gives you an opportunity to start practicing some of those job searching skills that you're going to need once you graduate and enter the market and again let's remember it's not it's not just students and new grads who need the benefit of these internships as people who are changing careers that could be changing drastically maybe going from teaching in an elementary school to to to going into counseling or you know some kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but call'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'manual field or or into accounting or something like that where there's there is like shraddha said there is some ownership on our part to do some vetting and investigation to find out about the specifics of the internship when you know when we're expected to be there the the the the hours we're supposed to work what hour job description is going to be who's gonna be responsible for us who do we answer to you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and we have to do some of our own investigation and those skills like if if internships were illegal and we couldn't do them then we would not start developing practicing those things that we need to implement when we actually get out into the workforce and start looking for you know our viable employment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your temporary job position that may lead to full time employment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think college student often need to work to support themselves and their families when we are in college our family there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well a family want our support and i thought some employee will offer job based on recommendation from previous intern many don't do this at all if internship perform in college days this could be a problem later and may not have the structure we expect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of it a lot of interns work additional job i mean it it it is it's very tough to find time for for school for family and for the internship but again it's adding value to your skill set and your qualifications making you more attractive to employers so there there is a gain on the behalf of the person who is doing the internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'although it is i grieve very challenging to make ends meet and support your family when you're not getting paid so so many people have to work a job where they're getting paid in addition to doing their internship and you know it can be done it can be done it's hard but it can be done'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but but but but how do you how do you deal with it if you're let's say'",
        "'speaker_2': 'again'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the you're coming from from a poor family and so so and and you do have a very time-consuming internship but you're not getting paid i mean i mean outside of that i'm i mean how many hours can you fit in working possibly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the minimum wage job to to even support yourself'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the i mean there there is one of the the difficulties that has to be addressed but i don't think that that's an argument for making unpaid internships illegal because then that counts out all of the people who possibly do have the support of family do have a part time job may work on campus to help pay off some of the bills i mean you make a very valid point it is is the reality that there are people who are you know lower income the only time they have is for school and for their part time job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that it's important to kind of UM promote and advocate in the workforce so let's say a lot of those kinds of jobs that students would have would be like fast food restaurants or working at the mall or retail kind of encouraging bosses to allow and be flexible and provide time for your your student or your employee to do internships to to better themselves kind of kind of creating a culture around it i guess is really the only way i can see the address it but it is a very hard problem to tackle'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with your name and a sugar like i i guess you would know that we have the education loan option there even if we take the loan it's not that you have to work right away with your college and you have to repay it even the banks they give you some time even after you complete your degree they give you a time of one year to find a good job and then you start repaying the loan so this was one option another option is if a student is really willing to do some course or a degree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they opt for a full time course which most of the students do so what if your college doesn't really allow you to do any sort of full time jobs or as internships and you are required to complete what we have like the seventy percent attendance clause like student will definitely find a way to earn something or do some other mini job like john and mentioned in a fast food restaurant which they offer after your college hours like after three PM'",
        "'speaker_2': 'five PM so you will anyways find a way right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what about the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah look you are talking about a loan so everybody don't get a loan'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our education system that our education system is not that much mature that give everybody needed people to give a loan so i thought the education loan is get to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a i think education system is not that much mature and we feel responsible when we paid our pocket is full of our hard work and we feel happy to pay our expenses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK but again but OK so again i will'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bring up my previous point like internship being paid and unpaid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now it shouldn't be illegal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because you can always welcome in your job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you can do whatever you want but according to me we should be paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because it gives us motivation towards our future'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's true so OK it being is there a way to make an unpaid internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'compensated to with something while not making it illegal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'let's say you UM if if it's at a at a you're doing an internship at a at a medical clinic for billing and coding OK so you have to put in the medical bills for the codes the icd nine codes for whatever the doctor does so if he does an exam if he checks your throat and then he checks your eyes and then he prescribed me you're doing an internship for that but you're not getting paid but you can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh maybe you and one family member can have a one free check up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm a month while you're doing the internship or they provide you free lunch every day while you're there or you get a public transportation card or something like that there are ways around some forms of compensation without making the whole'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bethel illegal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that because you are going to incur expense getting back and forth that's a whole nother thing we haven't spoken about so you're not getting paid for this internship right and you have to spend money on gas or transportation or have to get there there are ways to kind of help incentivize or provide something for that intern without paying them hourly or salary'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but not making it illegal for them to be there at the same time what are your thoughts on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'she's a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah but many of you many needed people do job to fulfill their stomach and but for what is increasing it gives a way to get over a property when we get paid internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in india poverty is increasing day by day and i think a college student a fresher need to be paid it gives a responsible feeling towards our future our career'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so we should be paid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK because you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that it's possible that it may make the person less responsible if they're getting paid and potentially take that internship for granted you sometimes you work a little bit harder if you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if there's a risk of losing something or losing this opportunity and not taking for granted the fact that you're getting paid for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think when we work hard we should be paid because it it give our our our time is precious and we can give an another time another courses so when we give our company our patience time we should be paid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK because you mentioned about courses i don't know of any agency or any coaching classes who are giving the courses for free so why not just go for an internship and earn an experience a good exposure a good contact with colleagues along with free software learning and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'many other benefits other than monetary benefits because when you pay for a course you are only learning some theoretical stuff either online or by going to that place'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so why not an internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right you saying versus coming out of your pocket and spending the money on the course'",
