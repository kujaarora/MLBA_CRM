    "Do you agree artificial intelligence is helping and improving humanity?": [
        "'speaker_1': 'in just a second so just hang on there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yes how long do we have this conversation for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this is going to be for thirty minutes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so now we are recording and ready to go if i can have a duty if you could say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you esther'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you omar'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK guys so uh let's have a conversation go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so does do you agree artificial intelligence is helping and improving humanity but for me it's a big question and i don't think it's a a yes or a no i think that there are nuances and caveats just like with the internet'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's good sides to it and then there's bad sides to it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i believe i don't think so it's really helping in few scenarios for an example they are really impacting people 's job like you know the artificial intelligence is a solution of everything if you are a tutor or engineer or a teacher everything is going online and then every there are so many softwares in the market which really impacting the job of the human labor you can say that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i think unemployment is increasing somewhere just because of this because yeah so because so i'm opposing this topic and i don't think so we should promote this artificial intelligence i understand it is required in some scenarios but overall if i think about it it's really impacting the society in somewhere in the negative way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would like i said i think it will be good and it will be bad and as it will look at because it's so new it will look like ohh there's not gonna be enough jobs but AI will will because we don't even know it's a brave new world we don't know you know what the possibilities are completely like you know on an everyday level so who knows what kinds of jobs will come out of it so it might seem like that initially but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can't say cause look how many jobs have come out of the internet like who knew being a a social media influencer was gonna be a thing we didn't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so if i give'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes i think i think we have to be a little precise here like being being an A student i would like to make some points if you agree OK if you're not if you don't agree there is also OK because that's also in computer science we say a bad result it's still a result so i would like to make a few points'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so the first point would be the impact of AI on the job market i think it's more sort of a future work that we have to decide in the second point would have i would like to make is the use of AI in healthcare including drug discoveries and medical imaging because since the covered nineteenth and then we have noticed that a lot of medical staff were missing and they were refusing to work so what if some pandemics come later and we have to have some predefined'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the goals that we have to achieve the third point i would like to make is the ethical concentration'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's where it's gonna come in handy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i think i will i would like to add some points here like for an example nowadays chat GPT software is getting really attention of everyone and there are some researches on this software it it can give doctors exam it can clear lawyers exams so i think some people talk about that it's really a kind of threat to the artificial intelligence because children can misuse this or people can misuse this for an example it has cleared that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for american entrance exam for doctor so i think somewhere it can be missed used so so i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree i think it can be misused just like the infinite on the internet you'll have older men and and that you know praying on young girls there's like pedophilia because of the internet so they're absolutely is but i think those are the kinds of like those are the kinds of things that we do need to look at now how can it be abused and then how can it be counteracted not like with the internet we just like flew into it and then you know oh my god all of this difficult stuff has come up and then what do we do with it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but charge you pity but chargeability'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it can be yes yes of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they need to plan it from now like and and anticipate what could go wrong and how people could misuse it and harm other people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and i would like to add also that it's somewhere restrict the creativity of a person because you go online you get the answer for every questions and then i think it is somewhere restricted restricting our creativity we can't think as an individual we just use search engines every time and get the solution and answer for that sometimes a person get any sickness he just go to the google and search about the symptoms sometimes that makes you scare also like for an example you just vomited'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can you search why did i vomit then it will show you you might get cancer or you might got this abdominal pain or you might get this problem so sometimes that hype your tension you can say that i think somewhere it can give us negative impact overall i mean to say so there are different scenarios i think it's really giving'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean that's a point but it's it depends on how you use it for example chat should be the AI software cannot help us improve energy efficiency and reducing the carbon emissions so it's the same as how you use it if you if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm that's still meaning yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you say that it you say that it cannot'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i'm really worried about my children because me and my husband were discussing about this software that in future it can be really dangerous for children because right now they learn different theories and concepts from the through school curriculum but if they came to know about this software they might even this software can write an essay if a child is search about you know right to something so that limits their child 's creativity you can say that you can get answer of everything'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there is concern'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to through this software so i think in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't think it's gonna limit it's just gonna change it i think how how AI is not helping and improving how many it's not helping us with our fear like our fear we have so much fear about these things and i think that's that's damaging in itself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but uh umar you said that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to our mental health you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you were saying that chat GDP does not and will not help with climate change is that what you meant is that what you said'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not that climate change but it for example if energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our energy he said energy production energy efficiency'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you mean something that is applicable to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it could be it could be many ways it could be many ways it's not just one for example in healthcare we need some sort of automatization so we don't actually have to wait for the people to come at work for example i gave the example of covid nineteen pandemic if something in the future occurs god forbid not but if something occurs we need to have a mechanism to counter it so if AI'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you think that uh so what is your point you mean that it's too much uh there it's too focused on something like a chat bot rather than something that can be applied'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i would say that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i will just give a simple example it can be used in medical imaging for example to have the doctors make more accurate diagnosis and attack and like treat that diagnosis treat the disease they find and it can also be used in drug discovery to have research researchers identify new treatment plans more efficiently and more quickly so what's the harm in it if we use artificial intelligence to help'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the good cause i think there's no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think most people would agree that medical advancements is a good reason'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i would add on this i would like to add on this that precaution is always better than cure it says that so because people are getting lazy because of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it also tells you to it also tells you to it also tells it could also helps you to prevent yourself from forming such actions that could be harmful for you and your kids so that would also point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i think i think medically it could be helpful and it could improve humanity but then but but but but but at what but at what cost that's our only problem at what cost that's the that is it what cost'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and there's a lot of am there there is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think people are getting lazy because of this artificial intelligence'",
        "'speaker_1': 'perhaps'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what are some of the costs but what do you guys think are some of the costs that would happen because uh there's you're right there's a lot of different models for medical'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what about affordability well if it's really expensive and only some people can afford to get AI treatment you know what i mean then it's not helpful for everybody that could be one of the one of the costs like it will create even more of a divide in society between those who can afford it and those who can't and that that could lead to writing in the street i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a good idea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so yeah of course it is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that's true that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if the company use it in a good way they can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'did you use the computation cost and make it effectively and productively more results for the people who wants to have some kind of benefit from but of course if something has a benefit it will also have a constraint so we have to make sure that we don't allow a lot of people to just go and because charity it guarantees that it can predict the future i think this is a very very very high type of you can say statement but i don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i personally don't believe in that but still it is a statement so we have to counter it with some reasons and some strong points so that we can make a change'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the part of you know some of the problem is it's going to be i feel like you said the word the common man i think if the common man was was in charge of it and you know having a say in how certain certain aspects of AI were gonna be used in humanity but then i feel like money is gonna be a big part of it and then when money gets involved that's when it it becomes you know not helpful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to everybody and helpful to only a certain sector of support of society'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that could be just for a limited amount of time in the future in the next uh two years we could see the the cost is decreasing and the efficiency is increasing so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it'll be a more available to everyone but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think that's a very idealistic view'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right there's a potential for it to become'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oppressive is what i guess you're saying the periods and dividing between who's commoner and who is not but actually he's there's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know then because they're not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who's not exactly because you know they're not cutting the price of teslas so that the common man can afford one ohh they so why would they do it with a medical medical advancements you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'gary'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right but see there's like a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'thing not everyone can afford the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'huh gerti judy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it also improved improved'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i would like to add that not everyone can afford this for an example if we talk about like children use ipad at home or not everyone has that ipad so like like parents are getting pressure to arrange those gadgets for the children like their friends are having and then they have to follow that and some schools also provide the curriculum in which the gadgets are required i think so the it is really sometimes costly for the common person who can't afford that who doesn't have that much'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'income and salary and then they have to afford all of things for their family'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that gives a kind of pressure to the society'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i hear that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i guess that would be uh bad side of uh you technology use because there are a lot of people that can't afford devices and so they'll be they're kind of left behind but the other thing is there's software programs that are in the works and that are available where you would pay subscription to have a sort of an algorithm test your symptoms so that's one form of AI but the other thing is like do you guys would you trust that kind of a program'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no we don't trust actually sorry to say but yeah i think i get so many emails to get our software installed in my computer i get that marketing emails and i never trust those emails i never get even if they're paying ten pounds or twenty pound a month to get the software installed in the background and they will record everything of my data and all you know they give those kind of lucrative offer to you but i don't trust them and i never opt for those softwares to provide my details'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well not in this moment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'name'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which kind of data use in my day to day life so i not at all trust'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so imagine putting your health in in the hands as i but i mean you know people don't some people don't trust the GP they don't trust the doctor so it's one of those it's one of those things that we will get used to you know and we will get used to it especially if if money is involved'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that's true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like i mean i mean from a single text until writing a complete report we are generating some sort of data and AI something you strain on that data so if i think if we put our focus more on improving the data so yeah i don't make ridiculous decisions for us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i have a doctor at home so i completely trust the doctors'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are two parts of it you train a model and then you test it on something that is that have been already separated for such time such kind of tasks but if the data is good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's just a matter of time before things become more accurate or trustworthy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you say something what would be the same thing a person'",
        "'speaker_4': 'her'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you said test it on something what would be the thing a person a cat and mouse like which what do you mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no no no it would be the same data it would it would be the same data there is a there's data we split the data we train the machine or or AI in our sense we train the machine on eighty percent of that data and we test the machine on twenty percent of the same data so the data has to be improved this is my point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK i'm i don't have that background i'm very much a layman you know i'm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i know it's not i'm just making it more simple i'm making it more simple so there are at my'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah even i don't have that background'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well there's a couple of different ways that there's a couple of different AI actually so there's like a software program right the the one that we would use from a computer app to test our health there's even financial AI how do you guys would you guys trust like a financial advisor AI'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think in in our daily life we are dealing with such kind of financial advice for example google pay paypal everything is here i so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah of course if we opt for a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i use paypal i use'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but they don't paypal and google are not giving a financial advice like an advisor like if you had to use a an advisor like if you were thinking about investing and you were chatting with a chat bot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would you how would you how would you guys feel about that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so in that case i only trust my uh my bank accounts chat bot app through my bank account app i don't trust other apps i only trust my bank account app to do any kind of chat or sometimes i go in person and discuss about my financial thing so i don't trust that much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right see i mean yeah i mean i don't know i mean i would have to know how is it programmed how does it know if i ask it if i invested a hundred thousand pounds in this property in this area when would i get back if if i mean how is it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'main'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's crazy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes but this is a point this is the point you're getting there you're getting there i'm really happy you're getting there if if a chat bot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know i'd wanna know how it's how it's calculating that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm actually i'm actually i think i think you know maybe a computer would be better at figuring that out than a mortgage broker with another human like me i mean i don't know but i'd wanna know the background and i'd wanna know that someone else did it first like it was tested'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the for for example if if a chat bot is suggesting something you you being human people can analyze if the decision is good for you or bad for you if if you don't have the knowledge yet come the chat GPT into the place you search for it if the if you give your data OK i have this problem would it be good in one year from now or six months from now it can help you make better decisions so that was all fun'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so there are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'may'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you see joy tea that there's a job there because it will be someone between the AI and then you know and the person and they will help them to decide to they're still gonna be job there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i would say that i am using a trading app and i one day i was discussing with my husband that what happens if the everything got crashed where will be my account go and how will i get my data retrieved you know if something can happen with the whole world you never know actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you never know you never know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah so i i was confused everything is online'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well the there was there there was a bank here several years ago in the UK having it was called the northern bank and it ran out of money and people were queuing down the road for their money do you know what i mean so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ran out of money well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah you're the back didn't have any money and people like ohh my goodness and queuing knocking on yeah you can look it up it was called the northern bank yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'my goodness'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good god'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i am going to look that up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's new that's new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so can happen with that you can happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah i've been didn't about heard about it yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes you remember yeah yeah but i mean my other thing as well is OK so there's going to be a UI that is in the form of a of an app on a program but then i've also seen robots online who are like doing funky hip hop dances i watched one it was like robot that was on all fours and i found it quite scary actually and it actually managed to open a door it opened a door'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those are gonna be good as they're because uh like they'd be good for human things that like if uh even replacing firefighters that's something that are going into dangerous places along time ago we had a people doing the dangerous labor but now maybe we could get in some AI but my thing is i think that we should have like an ethical'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i think it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a set of ethics that humans go by to protect the AI what do you guys think about that if they're doing some kind of job like that'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so there's a lot of there's a lot of good advantages of having AI instead of the GPS all sorts of stuff that's supposed to be a little bit more convenient but do you do you guys actually feel convenience or do you feel like it's another app it's another i have to carry my mobile what do you think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'but i don't think AI and AI is not gonna be able to write a poem the way that myself or my peers would write poems'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
