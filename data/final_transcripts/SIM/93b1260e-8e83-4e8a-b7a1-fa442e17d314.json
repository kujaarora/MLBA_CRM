        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'restaurant workers need to make sure they earn their tips'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it almost seems like cause you gotta you know respect people who you come into contact with but it almost seems like i don't i don't know about you guys but if i were to work in the restaurant i might be a little more less light or a little less likely yes i'd still treat people like i would love to treat people nicely you gotta still do that but you might feel less motivated if you're not making as much so you might be stressing on ohh shoot i gotta try to be this way so i can actually make some decent money to keep myself going'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i think you you definitely got to be more productive if you're making more money to some extent though'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you you you do get maybe some more production if you spend more money on on wages you're going to get more more production out of your employees so there's that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i feel like you could still'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the thing but i mean i still feel like people deserve tips if they do even if they're making a lot of money you know if they're nice people like if they really do you know like if say they over'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know the mother started'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know they do more than they necessarily have to not in a bad way or anything but i mean some people really deserve that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tips but i mean i get that you know like i i wouldn't stop tipping like if somebody 's doing their work good i'm still gonna tip just as much even if i knew they were making more because it's them as a person there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean the way they started tips was they would tip black people to keep them down make them feel like they were inferior so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know i would just it's a cultural thing i but i i believe that it should be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tipping should be phased out and just is everything be paid in your wages'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's too many people don't tip'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hey there yep we can carry you'",

        "'speaker_4': 'well my that why i my mentality was that that minimum wage should be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'should be high but the condition where india there is many engineers there going through the laying of and jobless are become the count of jobless or become increasing that's why i said that minimum wage should be high because the inflation is also increasing in india'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the current scenario is'",

        "'speaker_2': 'you know there's a lot of controversy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and the big thing here in texas to the reason we're we have not raised it past the federal minimum wage is because we have a lot of we have a lot of people on work visas we have a lot of you know migrant workers including a lot of people that every day they cross the border to work so i know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well we'll never go more in federal wage because of that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they don't want to pay those people more i was curious what you guys think i've heard'",

        "'speaker_3': 'what you guys thought of does that make sense to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'take care of the especially if you if you're living the US versus someone who's just you know crossing the border every day to work in a border town that heading back to mexico'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know if i see that as super fair either because you know they're still doing the same thing yes they're from a different but think about i don't know if it cost to get over the border like how much you know how you know to go into different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know they're taking the time to actually do that but i still don't know that texas i still don't know that that should be a reason to not change the wages because if they're living 's going up the cost of living is going up in texas you said correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah yeah it's it's cool'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah yeah by a lot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then how come my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how come the wages are as well because they're not gonna be able to like people can only keep up so much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know i i don't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what yeah that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well they don't have a work visa i get that guarantee they're not even making minimum wage there's that's where they didn't advantage of people there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so that's that's just that you know like so for people that are taking the time to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the illegal migrants'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know come over i think it you know if people are allowed to be there to work then they should still like if they're doing it legally'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then they should still like i think they should get the wage because uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you get the same way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know they're still taking their time and sometimes it could almost cost more depending on where they're coming from cost more to keep themselves going than it would be to just work somewhere there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it almost seems like greed from people in the US sometimes i hate to say it like that but if they're gonna judge that based on how many people come over to work it's like ohh you mean so we got people coming over here to help us so we're not gonna do anything different for them or like we're not gonna do anything you know to change for everybody overall even though we have these people that are taking their time from another country to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know come help us we're not gonna do anything about it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh yeah no i tell you cause i've i've crossed i live in north texas and dallas fort worth area but i've crossed the border a couple places multiple times and yeah i mean for if you're not a citizen if you're coming across that sometimes they'll be waiting an hour to to to cross and yeah come work eight hours and like'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah there's there's some i mean then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then of course i mean there there's that's why in texas we never done anything with like E verify or or verifying citizenship because there's so many companies that do take advantage of the the you know the people are here illegally and not paying them much or you're paying them under the table'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it it seems like excuses to not but i mean the'",
