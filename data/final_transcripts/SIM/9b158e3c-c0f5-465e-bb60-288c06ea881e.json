        "'speaker_3': 'you know in my opinion i feel that a person should always dress business like and appropriate when looking to land a job or any type of gig but to me all the factors i mentioned should come into play when looking to hire someone for a position and i think that companies that hire you know solely based on appearance they end up losing in the long run because they have let the person who was more qualified for the job get away'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know by hiring someone simply for how they look so that's my opinion'",

        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh what about you david'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think i think generally speaking it speaking as a rule of thumb parents should not be a factor but of course if someone shows up to an interview all sloppy and everything i think you should take that you should take that into account if someone is just sloppy in their appearance and in an interview'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i feel like OK yeah OK potentially you can do that as far as i think there are some occupations where appearance should be a factor let's say you know in the modeling industry obviously or an actor if they're looking for a specific actor and wouldn't an actor should look like in the entertainment industry i feel like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's maybe an extended exception to the rule if you're looking to to to to hire at a TV anchor or a or a host for a TV show obviously appearance would play a factor in that but i think generally speaking for for most of corporate america appearance shouldn't be a factor it should be based on you know your accomplishments your talent your potential etcetera that type of thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK i i guess then i will try to be pro and because all of you have mentioned that you know there is such factors that what you're wearing how formally you addressed and well this is an appearance i mean it's like yeah they usually will tell you that you know that shows what your attitude to your work is but it's not necessarily'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so it's still kind of like everybody 's there's some appearance factor in are you gonna be hired or not so shouldn't we be better to just to accept it to say like yeah appearance is a factor pretty people are getting hired more than their no notice pretty ones'",
        "'speaker_3': 'based on looks only'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh well the only only part is a very you know questionable here like i'm i mean hopefully not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's a lot there's a lot of prejudices there's a lot of prejudice still in the world i i think we're a long way from where we were but there is a lot of prejudice in this world there's a there's a lot of'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know it's sad that in the world people still do naturally judge and it it's quite sad but i think in terms of appearance and what's acceptable or quote unquote acceptable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think we're a long way from where we were i i think we've made some progress'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you still said that you know you have to wear uniform and you are a pilot like does the uniform affect your piloting skills or you know color of your skin or your you know if you're transgender or not you even think no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not at all not at all it doesn't and it's i think it's what the public and what the paying passengers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want it's potentially what they want to see if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for example they're getting on an aircraft and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're not comfortable with how you appear i mean it's a really really touchy issue for a lot of people and i take pride in my parents but i don't judge people based i don't judge people based on appearance because i actually have made that mistake before where i've judged people on appearance and i've always in my younger years i've always regretted it i've always i've never got the right answer from it it's always been the wrong answer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know in in reference to what daniel just said i i worked for an airline for nine years i worked directly at the airport and we had to of course be in uniform just like you said we had to dress a certain type of way but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know according to the you know the rules of the airline if i went out after work and i wasn't on my shift if i went to a bar or if i went out to dinner or something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm you know they didn't want us wearing our uniform because we had to you know represent we have to represent the airlines so you have to actually act a certain way so i mean appearance does have a lot to do with it but then again too it it has a lot to do with how you project yourself so it's not just about your looks as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree completely i completely agree with all that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so i think it's just you know even though you know it could be like corporate policy etcetera not to do anything based or make decisions based on a person 's appearance i feel like it's just human nature you know there's a human nature factor that you can't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's hard to legislate out of things for instance if there are two candidates for a position in everything you all else being equal i'm just by human nature i'm just gonna be inclined to lean toward the person who's more attractive that's just human nature so that's just something that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know it's it's really hard to to just get rid of that human nature fact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well we'll we'll do you think we should kind of policy out the human nature out of this decision'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we should what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like we we we should create the policies that will kind of remove this human nature aspect out of this decision'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well the only way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's i think it's i think it's already i think it's already gone that way because a lot of a lot of interviews and a lot of recruitment policies are now done are now done on a completely points uh point based process so like you have a certain amount of points and if you hit that target points it's the most amount of points and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you don't get any points for a parents so i think there is legislation there is processes that are that are in place in modern in modern companies or maybe i would say four thinking companies where they hire based on on your point score and as i said earlier your point score is not based on how you look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what what OK let let let me give you a counter argument to that and it will be that OK if any company they will have a sales department and sales research department and most of them will come and tell you that you know if we have prettier people that are serving people that are selling things to people they tend to have more sales'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and on the the purely capitalistic point of view there will be like well more sales you know better for us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but nikita my thing is it it's all well and good that you're going to be you know if you have a pretty person behind that counter they think that because of those looks you're gonna be making sales but if that pretty person doesn't know anything about the products that they're selling you know so what's the sense of it if you if you don't have a brain in your in your head'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no absolutely yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they still need to be competent yeah well yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know you got to have something besides the looks you have to have some type of brain or something uh to go along with these looks so you know i i don't i don't know but that's just me you know that's just my opinion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i i i agree with you i mean luckily for me i mean i'm mostly a programmer so i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i i have to be honest i have to be honest'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not very getting judged for that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if i was running a sales team i would want my sales team i would i would like them to be all attractive people you know just because it's just this i think statistically you know more attractive people make more sales but you know i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but david they have to have a brain in their head to make to make us to make a seal you it's all well and good to have these good looks but if you're gonna send somebody out there to to to make sales and they don't have a brain in their head they don't know anything about the product how are they gonna sell something that they don't have a clue about you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly well of course of course of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly exactly so so so that that wouldn't be that wouldn't be the only criteria you know but if if they were if they were smart you know it it you know you know outgoing good salespeople it's just it's a bonus that they're attracted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so the idea that should be smart pretty wealthy healthy and all these things at the same time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'all on TV'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think it's some i think it's something out of area fifty one you know if you can find someone that's looks perfect and it's absolutely smart i think yeah that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'without'",
