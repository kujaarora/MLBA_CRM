        "'speaker_4': 'cool'",

        "'speaker_3': 'perfect thank you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so today's topic is is the best way to combat climate change for individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and before we start'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would like to point out that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'participants are highly encouraged to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a chip in while someone else is talking like like agreeing as in saying OK or mm-hmm or strongly disagreeing or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or if you have to interrupt to to ask questions to further clarify what they're saying or if you're feeling someone is nearing the end and you wanna add something to that or counter that you are highly encouraged to do so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh let me assign the roles then so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's a first for me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i suggest that michael and jeanine you take the pro side'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and uh class and i will take the con side is that OK with you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well actually i'll i'll i'll i'll although i am of the opinion that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is some lot of the best way to combat climate change if individuals reduce their carbon footprint'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'll gladly take the role you're assigning me events but i just wanna make clear up front but i think that that is not correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so do you want to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh i assigned you to the to the pro side so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so to clarify aren't you pro or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no he's saying'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i i i i think that the whole carbon footprint thing is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a fabrication of the fossil fuel industry to pull the wool over people 's eyes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what's so so maybe michael can go to the to the against the version'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sounds good to me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK great then uh who would like to start just go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i will start by saying with regard to the topic i my interest was peaked as well just by the way the why it's framed because it does suggest that the best way to combat climate change relies on individual'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'perspective and action and so i know that there are several ways that we as individuals who occupy this planet can contribute to the reduction of you know climate change but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i i don't know that i would necessarily say it's the best either but i know that there are so many ways that we could contribute that they make a significant impact and some of them include of course the level or the amount and type of energy that we use in our homes our vehicle and transportation choices whether or not we eat meat with the manufacturing and production of cattle that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put methane in the air even the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'waste you know whatever garbage we're throwing out if we're throwing away food wastefully you know that's going to rot in landfills and that contributes with with methane so i know that i don't know that it's the best but i know that there are so many different ways that we can pack we can walk we can bike'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well actually the the the best way if you want to reduce your individual carbon footprint is to not have children'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'best thing you can do for the climate don't have children don't start with it don't continue with it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ooh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'interesting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what while individuals that that that don't exist can't make a contribution'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some sort of an abstract and yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the in in the meantime we will need people to look after the the elderly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'before they before we go extinct but if we want the human race to survive we need to do that on a lot fewer resources and with a lot a lot fewer fewer to your missions and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that that is that is correct but the individual contributions by people compared to industry and governments is absolutely miniscule'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i i i i think so too'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and that's where the problem comes in the whole issue has been framed as something that individuals can prevent climate change we can stop global warming if we all just eat fewer burgers and we all drive electric cars i mean i'm all for electric cars'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh they're much better performing vehicles there is no big block of metal in the front vibrating the whole thing apart so they have a lot less maintenance issues too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well to to to the extent that you refer to industry and if i buy an electric vehicle in germany i'm talking from germany here today then half the electricity is coming from from burning carbon but most of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well actually you do have the choice of who your provider is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh you have to talk to the provider is but as an individual i can still make the choice to to buy an electric vehicle i can then add on where i buy my electricity from and over time we will get to a point where of course industry will reduce'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but to but to that point overall'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the use of fossil fuels for electricity production so to take the step have a much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but electricity production is only one part of it i mean then there's construction you need to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'fabricate concrete that has a massive CO two footprint a production of steel has a massive CO two footprint and then let's not forget for example in the USA who do you think is the biggest emitter of CO two and toxic emissions in the united states'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the armed forces'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well warsi huge source of tier two emissions and and we feel'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that that's without even having a war that's just being ready for one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i think overall to the overall point if we as individuals subscribe to an ideology that there is something that we independently can do it's people that run these corporations it's people that are making these decisions and sitting at the table so if i and my home decide OK i'm gonna reduce i'm gonna reuse i'm gonna repair i'm gonna recycle i'm gonna throw away less food i'm going to eat more vegetables i'm gonna consider my travel i'm not gonna book as many meetings in asia and wherever you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm good pointer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i'm gonna reduce my airplane usage so if i personally subscribe to all of these individual actions that i can take when i make decisions corporately and i impact the decisions of the organizations that are emitting all these fossil fuels and doing all of these different things then i think that it can carry over into like what you're saying the biggest producers of of these things that are eating away at the ozone and and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'dude'",
        "'speaker_1': 'causing climate change to happen everything starts with us you know as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what well that that that is a nice thought and that's precisely what the designers of the campaign of the carbon footprint had in mind because that whole'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'advertising campaign that's being forced upon us for the last'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'let's say five to eight years originated with BP and is being handled by the ad agencies that also give us whoppers like more doctors smoke camels'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm OK right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'same companies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'vehicles and they're using solar and wind energy in their huge campuses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that's all great and commendable but compared to BP shell exxon mobil and texaco who are who are spending billions upon billions just to confuse the public'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh putting into doubt whether'",
        "'speaker_4': 'climate change even exists'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh all of that is absolutely meaningless because our emissions are still going up we're at four hundred and twenty parts per billion right now which is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about fifteen parts per billion more than it was about three years ago and we're still on an upward going trend and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if the people that are the consumers of these products people are consuming the products so if the people if there's impact where the people say OK we're not gonna support that that company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'michael black pointed II'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people are consuming the product and and you will never get the vast majority of people to behave like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'responsible citizens of the world'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well if we give up at this point this is actually dangerous what you're saying michael it's dangerous because you're you're giving the impression as if people didn't have the choice didn't have the power side how they consume and we don't convince the people if we don't convince the people the the businesses will not change their ways they will not produce the products which have no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they have the choice but more far more important than'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right come alongside'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what what what businesses will not change their way because of the effort of a few million individual citizens businesses will change their ways when polished when politics tells them that they have to politics are far more important than individual action'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who billions billions'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes politics are operated by the politicians who are people who are supposed to respond to their constituents in their districts so if the district is full of people who speak to the policy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well at least in democrat'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well but unfortunately there respond to the people writing them the checks to run the campaigns'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i would think that but but all three of us live in democracies so it it is the people who access the pressure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh so so called democracies yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah pressure an appropriate amount of pressure does bring about change'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes sir so me being on the on the cost side here as well so my question is uh if we look at climate change so the question asks whether reducing carbon footprint is the best way to stop climate change but my question here is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so since climate change is somewhat cyclical in earth 's history and so the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the thesis here is that our emissions have kind of i don't know accelerated that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the uh that cycle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'my question is is it even'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh possible for us to to stop climate change the way we would need it to stop and especially by reducing something like carbon footprint'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think it's possible to to reduce it and impact it but at the lengths that we would need to go to drastically and significantly impact it at the speed that we need to do so so that we're not continuing to have these major weather events and things of that nature is very very difficult'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well actually actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now what what without carbon sequestration and active'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actively pulling CO two out of the atmosphere we are not even gonna get close to the paris accords'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what while that while i support that while that is correct without reducing our emissions sequestration will just be far too expensive we can't say we're still burning fossil fuel and capture the CO two later we have to reduce the fossil fuel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'however we still need to capture we still need to sequestrate and and and and banker that CO two somewhere and the ground but but that's just an add on it is no excuse for not reducing the individuals CO two footprint'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but but but but once again class whatever individuals do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is still only a small portion'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of what industry and governments do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'need to do to make this work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes but when you think about the population of the earth there are billions and billions and billions of people let's just say for arguments sake that you could convince every single individual on this earth'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to put into effect several of the different things that we've stated that would individually impact billions of people do you not then think that it would at least bring us closer to combating climate change'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do you seriously think you could convince a majority of people when for example in your native country there were seventy three million yeah seventy three million people stupid enough to vote for trump for a second time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a whole nother conversation i agree that was a whole lot of stupidity with regard to those folks i didn't make it but yet and the point is so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't distract from the core point here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well the the the the the the core point is you can never convince a majority to do the right thing just because it's the right thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but my question was my question was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'arguments sake if it could be with the the number of individuals that the question is could that individual impact come back climate change if it were possible of course we know that it's not but if it were would that be effective and i say yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and do you think that dictatorships are better at combating climate change i have i have i have great doubt to you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely not because china is building several new coal power plants a week so no dictatorships are certainly not better at it but the first thing that we need to do rather than eating a burger a week less is we need to actively combat misinformation that is being systematically used to dumb down the topic so that global corporations can happily keep making their profits'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well then that would mean that the part of the personal impact is put pressure on global theorizations mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when when we need to make sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well we we we buy these burgers from global corporations making huge profits and from a european perspective'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well i i i don't buy burgers from corporations anyway because they suck i'd rather make my own'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the the thing is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that as long as profits can be made by polluting and nobody goes after the polluters and we keep opening up public lands for pipelines and for drilling and for fracking none of none of what we're discussing is gonna make any difference if we don't go after the core issues stop fracking stop pipelines stop opening up public lines for drilling'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we need the people to go after the polluters to not buy their goods'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so michael even though i'm on the call side here with you but and so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'my question would be if people were reduced their carbon footprint wouldn't that somehow equate to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a big companies also producing less emission because there's less people buying from them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is theoretically correct in practice it makes really very little impact there is a youtube channel called climate town'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh there is a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a very well informed individual that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pulse that topic apart quite nicely the thing is about twenty five minutes half an hour long or so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i can only recommend you watch climate town and watch just have a think by a british fellow who also talks weekly every sunday about these kinds of issues and goes into the numbers and does a deep dive into what actually would work and what is being done and what isn't being done'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm not negating the importance of those facts that you bring up but i think it lot like my my team member said on the pro side it it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wait what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uhm dangerous to reduce the significance of or or to minimize i'll say the significance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm of the carbon footprint'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that's because the impact is that's because the impact that that's because the impact is minimal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's it's simple example from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it can still mitigate the effects of global climate i mean at least if we can mitigate some change'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's it's simple example from from from reverse from from from from from a large discount in germany little similar to aldi'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they have announced last week that they're going to buy less meat'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if a large discounter is buying less meat'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they that's the way they they they they promote it they present it to the consumer but the reality is they're buying less meat because the consumer is buying less meat but supermarket will will buy whatever the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'respond right the consumer responded to the market and the consumer'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whatever the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh that that that that that may well be true but now look at the reality class the german population represents one point two five percent of the global population so it's miniscule meanwhile we have large swath of people in china and in developing countries in africa that do wanna eat more meat and keep eating more meat every year'",
        "'speaker_2': 'customer demand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct and and because there are more than ten times more they're more than ten times more people in china than in germany but on the on the other hand the chinese have still a much lower income per head if we don't go ahead and show that it can be done differently we can't expect from the billion people in china that they are going to eat less meat we we have to do it first they're on the lower income that yeah they're progressing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and while people get richer they made more CO two which is a problem but we can't deny the poor people to get richer just because we wanna emit the same amount of sio two as we have been doing for the past decades'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'however i still believe that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the whole issue of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the framing of the carbon footprint is where the problem lies it's being suggested that individual action can be the primary driver in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the question'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stopping climate change and i maintain absolutely not true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that you have a point regarding the the impact of the bigger companies yeah i i agree that there are there's a huge amount of responsibility on the major players in this game obviously there is but that does not negate the significance of the individual and the reduction of a person 's carbon footprint on the game as well that's my position'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes speak cause'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which is which is precisely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because culprits won't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'trying to work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which is precisely the goal of that campaign of those TV commercials that have been put forth by BP shell chevron and others'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and when i say that's my position because i do still think that there is some power in the people who who can help to affect change in policy regulation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there is some power in the people but but but but it is absolutely miniscule compared to politics and control of industry and getting capitalism under control because that's that's the underlying problem of the whole thing capital'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right the the almighty dollar'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if if if more people want to fly in airplanes what are KLM and american airlines going to do they're going to buy more airplanes aren't they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a few people wanna fly they they will if fewer people wanna fly they will never down there the the the stock off of airplane'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if we boycott'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well well the thing is that that if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah commercialism absolutely responds to the market demand it just is what it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if if if if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well the the the the the thing is for example it take if you take a look at the monies government spent on RND in renewable energies if you put in an effort like it was put into the apollo mission to go to the moon if you put that kind of effort into developing carbon neutral airplanes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then you solve that issue but you have to have a government that is willing to spend massive amounts of money to make that kind of thing happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes and i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because it's possible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes and i i think it's the little person'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and and you build that pressure by simply flying less and then the airplane manufacturers will come and say we need to change our weights and going back to the little example you don't expect KLM to say we are going to operate fewer airplanes they they're going to only say that once people want to fly less and if that builds up the pressure they will find they will find ways to solve their CO two missions problem'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well that that that that that that's a that's a beautiful'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that's a beautiful thought and and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well again as we are looking at countries like germany and other central european countries having responsible individuals that's call them who fly less meanwhile americans fly more and as developing nations develop they fly a whole hell of a lot more so whatever effort is being made here in germany or in the rest of europe is absolutely negated by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and therefore you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's being done elsewhere'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i think i think you're making our point for us by that statement there if americans fly fly flew less'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if they flew less but they don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then it would it would be in but it would be impactful'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but it's a hypothetical if then and the if isn't gonna happen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but the question is is that a way to impact it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what we're working on it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i i still think we need plans with electric motors and while i think that hydrogen for example is a fool 's errand when it comes to cars'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh for heavy transportation big trucks uh ships and planes hydrogen if if if it's if it's green hydrogen could well be the solution'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm storage yep energy storage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because you can unfortunately not put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a battery that weighs eighty tons onto a plane'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but developing these technologies costs a lot of money and effort and and and and and and green hydrogen is also an energy storage obviously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and that's and that's where governments need to step in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and therefore'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see in in germany for example the support of the solar energy industry the way it was fifteen twelve fifteen years ago was absolutely the right thing to do and then they just cut out the funding'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and from being the leading producer of solar panels in the world they become a back became a back marker'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that was painful yes yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's because government action wasn't taken properly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but germany is a democracy and the german public that had happened so it is it is changing again and it's public pressure building up to to to like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and and and and and a little war in ukraine huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but but but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i as a consequence i have is solar i have a couple of solar panels outside now and our conversation is powered by my part of the conversation is powered by that energy at the moment yes that is shining'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean since i've been back in germany i have always contracted for oklahoma yeah i do not use anything that either burns coal or gets new power from the french'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes but you when when you contract'",
        "'speaker_2': 'green electricity much of it is produced by the large companies that that that use nuclear or carbon and part of that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wind turbines or or whatever other renewable sources and they just sell you the renewable part at a at an extra price as as green it just make it more expensive but the the way to go is to buy from people only only produced renewable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and what what what well the thing is i have i have been paying more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i have been paying more all though to produce electricity with solar and wind is by now significantly cheaper than anything else particularly the last mile gas powered plants so i've been paying in for the last nine years here only to now get totally screwed by still having to pay forty percent more than i did last year'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes my provider is is only uses hydrogen power and and the the the cost of that is the same doesn't change what is running'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and and and and hydrogen is another issue right there yeah are we talking about grey hydrogen green hydrogen or so called blue hydrogen as long as you take in methane gas and you're stripping off the carbon in refraction methods then the whole hydrogen infrastructure is meaningless as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes but if enough consumers consume demand green energy for example the the the the the the market price for carbon intensive fossil fuel powered electricity will drop'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's how markets work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because of the demand and it has health benefits health there several health benefits of reducing the carbon emissions and using cleaner energy as well so if you have a healthier population because more people are walking more people are eating vegetables you know all these different things you have a healthier population there is less of a burden on the health care industry which has to use lots of machinery and chemicals for you know pharmaceuticals and things of that nature where we're still impacting and improving'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and and and and and that that's the thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's true yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the UM the reduction of carbon'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and and and i'm not saying that those things do not have an impact what i am saying is rather than individual action'",
        "'speaker_4': 'governments need to direct funds into the correct areas in order to make these things happen far faster than it would take for it to occur so people would accept it because economically it's better for them because the majority of people will never do something just because it's good for the planet'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right so wouldn't you say it both end'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah unfortunately'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so so so michael did i get you right that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in theory you would agree that reducing carbon footprint would be the way but you just don't think that it's pragmatic or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is a good way but it's it's certainly is not the way the question is framed is the best way to combat climate climate change and the best way is to not individual action the best way is massive government investment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the best'",
        "'speaker_1': 'best'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah to take real action now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i think individuals make up government and we we propel disapprove of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you see'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if it's if it's city dweller in in rotterdam or portland decides in the morning to mount his bike and her bike and cycle to work it's a contribution to reducing CO two emissions over another city dweller her deciding to drive to work and it's it apart from as janine pointed out many of these measures are are healthy they're good for the year good for personal health'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it's an individual choice and millions of people fail to make that choice ask anybody in houston why they don't cycle to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right exactly and and and the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's'",
