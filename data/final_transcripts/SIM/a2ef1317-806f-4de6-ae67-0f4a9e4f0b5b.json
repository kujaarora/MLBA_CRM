        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can would you like to make an opening statement'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sure i definitely feel like companies should be allowed to hire whoever they feel like is going to best represent their brand and what they are standing for i think it doesn't make sense if i were a company that let's say i specifically made products for curly hair it wouldn't make sense to hire'",
        "'speaker_3': 'entire like people straight hair people who don't even fit the brand that i'm creating to market my company i should be allowed to pick people you know based on the features that i feel fit my brand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK anthony'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is actually an interesting approach it's actually very interesting approach to a quite ethical question we need to discuss so yeah obviously when we need to sell product for curly head we need to employ people representing our brand that currently have however i can give you a simple example where for example closing brand right everyone can wear clothes right everyone needs close different clothes for different sizes beach outside exercise casual'",
        "'speaker_1': 'elena'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and abercrombie fitch for example the company which promotes all young twenty something year old models there employed specifically to attract more buyers into their shops where where obviously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people believe people have that false false thoughts that are you gonna get this clothes and you're gonna look the same young wild hand muscles and everything we should basically selling a false dreams so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i believe companies should actually promote healthy and body positive health and body positivity rather than just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'filtering people how they look like feet tall muscles and then that two inches'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anthony you got something to add'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can see where you're coming from there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i do i mean i think what we're talking about more than anything is discrimination and i mean discrimination is on the basis of physical appearance is illegal under federal law in the united states and many other countries'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so to discriminate against someone for hiring if they you know based on their race or gender or their age or their physical appearance is against the law and hiring based on looks can also be seen as a form of bias and can lead to a lack of diversity in the workplace'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but how does it work in the fashion industry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i'm i'm yet to see someone who's not so sort of physically attractive posing for a mega brand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think you know a perfect example of that is victoria's secret how you know years ago they weren't able to show you know negative body types but they've adapted their product line to you know women that wouldn't be traditionally seen as attractive and they have many plus size models and many women that wouldn't traditionally be seen as you know supermodels and they've adapted their you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but don't don't don't you take the businesses and and society as a whole should should have the freedom to do whatever they feel is right and not enforced by law'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i think the law is what is actually you know put in place to keep people protected that might not have you know the perfect body type or the perfect image or whatever and to not hire them is discriminatory so i feel for the people that wouldn't be able to be hired'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i think that the difference between the examples that you both gave and my example is that plus size people in bigger people can still wear lingerie you've like a person with straight hair doesn't need curly hair products but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that people still need clothes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'count and it just that's the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but on the other hand i have you ever'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the idea that if a person can't wear those things is is where the discrimination comes in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'play devil's advocate so from from from if if i have a fashion brand i don't necessarily care about the how you feel about it i i'm i'm more concerned about my capital and i want to earn money that's what i'm here for and and i would rather hire someone who would attract more people because otherwise i'm gonna lose money so what's in it for me to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hire someone who's not so aesthetically pleasing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but instead of actually making more money umm you would actually you you you should think about promoting body positivity in the quality and and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i don't i'm i'm i'm a capitalist'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm actually to attract more different you know parts of society people who are burned survivors people whose deformed the deformed that parents and things like that and unfortunately even like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so what if we don't want those parts of society involved in our brand if that's not how we see our brand and we're OK with losing out on the money from those groups then wouldn't it be OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anthony'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh choosing people just completely based on the opinions is clearly discriminated to the rest or actually majority who doesn't have a an ideal standards of beauty which is societies totally wrong i i agree with anthony where where in the USA they have the law supporting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh equality for people with different opinions participating in advertisements and campaigns'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but shouldn't be it it it our choice like if if someone doesn't like the idea or if some if if your brand is hiding only good looking people people can just boycott it why why do we have to enforce it by law and and take that sort of freedom away'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to extrapolate what you're saying then is that if you give them a hundred percent freedom to hire whoever they want what's wrong with them also saying that you can only hire females or you can only hire white people or you can only hire people that are under the age of fifty the reason that we have these laws in place is to protect everyone from hiring discriminated practices and i think it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but but if if if anthony if you look at at from an objective view if if i'm running a business i'll i would make decisions based on competence not based on diversity quotas i honestly if if you ask any capitalist who would say i'm here to make money i don't care about this society or like in general like i'm not here to reform the society i'm here to make money and i will do what's best for the business and that means hiring the most competent people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and if you're saying that everyone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'should get like a quota for diversity and and trying to match those things then it creates a lot of sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'imperfection in the system don't you think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do but i also i think that i mean the fact that they were just being able to hire skinny people or i i think that would be discriminatory and i i think it's going to eventually i mean it's gonna lead to a lack of diversity in the workplace so just having being able to allow your hiring decision based on physical appearance it's also going to lead to you know missed opportunities for other other qualified candidates who to no fault of their own might not meet a physical appearance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know what's to say if someone in a wheelchair or something they might not be the perfect you know image of your company but why would why would you think it's right for them to be discriminated based on something that's out of their control'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so so you're saying if if you have a company you would hire someone with with a disability to put it on on a fashion magazines poster but would you be willing to take that sort of risk'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think for companies that take that type of risk i mean they can you know set a new type of standard and i think there's actually a lot of you know companies that have done that that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have broken the mold of the you know fashion model or whatever like i said previously victoria's secret and there's opportunity in that so i think the best companies will adapt and hire people and you know it won't make their brand suffer at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just agree that they're cool that they ask why do we call it the risk because it's actually embracing and imperfections it's something that you should be proud of you should give people people with average appearance the chance to to to feel right in the society and in fact you know we were discussing only beauty industry like asia over to discuss currently have we discussed fashion industry but then the fact unfortunately discrimination on appearance is that every single field and i can give an simple exam example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it hasn't been struggling to be employed before court because obviously all interviews very one to one you know in the large companies you know all device you know wife callers and the seats are good looking tall handsome guys and my friend who literally took hundred kills who struggles to walk he couldn't find a job until quite stroke right and we all we got online on all you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'remote interviews and everything and he got a job only online because people were discriminating him because of how large he is and probably thinking that might be other team members wouldn't like working with him so let's not only fashion it's every everywhere i'm gonna give you another example'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when i was a student here in the UK i was looking for a bar job right and i just kind of i didn't have any experience in the bar before actually coming here many many many years ago and i made the CV and i sent so many series and nobody answers and i decided to put a lovely photo for me you know like kind of cheeky photo for me or on the CV and i sent it to one bar and i got immediately employed and my bar manager he said like well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when i saw your picture i knew you you just hit to our place which i found well it's a compliment probably but it is a few discrimination somebody probably who's worser than me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no but but but but if if you look at from their perspective'",
        "'speaker_3': 'your i would say though that your business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'me having a business that allows me to hire whoever i want to even based on just even based on their appearance doesn't mean that you or someone else can't still have a body positive or like forward thinking company where you hire who you want to and that can be diversity for you why does it have to be enforced for me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but why do you ignore skills and professionals like my friend from finance who has clearly experienced more than average team member of yours'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but but if if if if it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if if if i run a strip club let's say and nobody's gonna show up if i am a start hiring all the body positive strippers no one is gonna show up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why not it's sort of team as well and and and there are so many people out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you you can run this experiment it's it's it's a pretty easy how many people are gonna show up there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'quite a lot there are specific groups of people are interested in it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there are plus size strip clubs that only hire women over a certain size'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'll be very surprised'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or or men for that matter no no no one wants to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that that's still discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well so to thirty meter point aja come again'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they will see you sleep clubs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i said there are strip clubs even that only hire people who are above a certain weight or above a certain size and that still discrimination just on the other end of it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and and give you another example for the diversity argument that you guys are having so for example i i i'm part of a minority have a pretty arabic name and every company is trying to meet the requirements of diversity quotas and whatnot i don't want to be working at a place where i feel like that i'm part of a diversity quota or something and i'm sort of put in place instead of someone who's more competent than me but he happens to be a white straight male so how do you grapple with that and what is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'time the white state male apparently which is pretty frowned upon these days because he could be more competent than me and he deserving and if if that's the case in in a sort of certain demographic if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anyone if it's black or white that's our demographic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on average have more competence in that sort of segment then this should get the jobs regardless of how diverse they look'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm afraid we are talking about uh more morals and ethics because you know they are all promote trying all companies all big brands trying to promote diversity and all they say yeah diverse ethnic wise gender wise pay pay scale wise you know and in fact you know it's not what's happening between there you know curtains of that company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it is it is like now we have quotas and i work for a multinational and we have quotas honestly and it's getting absurd because you're not concerned about the competence anymore you're more concerned about having the right ratio of white to non whites and males to females and and competencies and afterthought which is a scary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if there's not some little kid i can give you an example i'm representing an one of the most prestigious universities in the world and the obviously diversity is a essential part of you know of our campaigns to recruit students however in administrative park and administrative part of of our of of university that is known diversity i can give an example in my previous team we had about fifty two people i was the only foreign non english speaking foreigner so which is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'come on it's not really what you try to represent for international students right and of course they try to promote me as an equality diversity and GI you know inclusivity community here as a chair because the problem they wanted to promote me because i'm the only foreigner i thanked them but i didn't join it so it's it's everything it's just a myth if it's exists in words really i just kind of nation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anthony would you like to jump in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so i mean i think what you were saying is that you're talking about hiring quotas where you know there are certain employees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i'm just just just worried about taking this diversity thing too far and then i think we should just step back and let the chips fall the way they do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah no so i think there's the key difference between having a hiring quota and and allowing a hiring practices that are discriminatory so you know if a company chooses to have a hiring quota and hire you know a certain percentage of this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no it's not informal quota but but we know what's happening'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like like like it's not said it out loud but when you when you see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but but i think that's still is a different thing than having you know categorically denying someone employment because of their attractiveness'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'certainly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'back to your point about a strip club you know if in an example if someone came in and said i would like to work at your club as a stripper you know i don't think it's it's well i know that it's not legal for the club owner to say i'm not going to hire you because i don't find you attractive i think in that specific case you're going to have a self selecting group i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's actually very legal that's that's pretty much i'm sorry i'm from atlanta which is like one of the strip club capitals of the US and it's very legal for them to not hire you because they don't find you attractive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK we we got some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it inside'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it makes a sound to go to atlanta actually you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's pretty much exactly how they do it you you know you get dressed up you go to the club and you audition and they judge you entirely based not only on i guess your poll or dancing skills but based on your appearance as well same for the bottle girls and the hostesses who pour the drinks for everyone in those clubs they also are chosen based on their appearance to the club manager'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but i come on it's it's a very ultra ultra you know niche examples street club of course you get paid for your body right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but the the the devil is in the details we need to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they think is player football player is not going to get paid if they're they're they're skills in ballet right so but but fashion industry or finance or i don't know retail but everyone can work they will this is discrimination towards the appearance less than average of what they call a norm i believe that all appearance should be equal they are all unique in in our uniqueness we should be employed and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh nicole writes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but here is another argument'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and i think it's a difference between if that is their hiring practice and the legality of it like i don't i don't they might hire that way but if if they were pressed by by you know by a legal action i'm pretty sure that what they're doing is still discriminatory and is against the law now if anyone going to sue a club owner for not hiring them that's a different thing but i'm pretty sure that's against a lot for them to do that whether or not you know that is their practice or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but then they they won't be any strip clubs left if if we start doing that right like the very few'",
        "'speaker_3': 'true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the business itself would lose its appeal it would lose the customers that come just for that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well you may be depressed i mean this it's there's that's here too there might be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'let's let's be honest let's be honest let's be honest'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so you have the whole porn industry that is sort of built on good looking people like it it's just you're selling a a sort of fantasy world or like like perfect images it's not necessarily sort of should determine your self worth right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there might opinion that are those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'alright so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i rounded it off everything about him'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hello'",
        "'speaker_2': 'look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anthony you there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm here'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are you there anthony'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah there there was a weird voice in between i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a sound'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i think i'm action might have been lost'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can we just keep them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah no no it's all good all good keep going guys'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohhh alright you you know he better discussing the strip clubs don't stop right but what about just other business that i don't know shop assistant why shop assistant should have a perfect appearance why finance manager should have a perfect appearance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i don't think so that's that's so much true annie'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as a slim man'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they don't necessarily have to discriminate based on whether or not you're pretty it can be other features as well you know maybe someone who who does delivery like who shops who does grocery shopping for delivery companies that deliver groceries to people they should be able to to walk quickly they should be relatively fit enough to be mobile to reach to top shelves things like that and that also is still a form of physical discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they don't really care about the locks yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with physically fit you mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is fair because that's their business and they because the other people can do the other jobs right but it's not so much with it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'correct yeah but we should uh we should understand that there is a drop requirements and job personal specifications right that you need to meet obviously you need to be fit to you know to be a shop assistant for example to stock you know shelves and everything but whereas there why nobody puts us further specification like you know nineteen sixty nine to measures you know one eighty five centimeters tall'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know and everything well actually actual an actual person specification you know why because this is an actual discrimination that's what they're gonna take it to the core nobody gonna put age on personal specification however i know that for certain roles like a PDA nobody wants the PA of seventy two years old right this is another type of discrimination'",
        "'speaker_1': 'don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i understand that view but don't you guys think that we all discriminate based on our personal preferences'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i'm sorry what do you mean discriminate are you talking about sexual preferences yes of course we have our preferences'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so for for for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no i i i can give you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah and that's that's a form of discrimination because why aren't you dating the other person because she'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it's not discrimination it's a sexual preference it's a sexual preference'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it is it is it it is in a way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you you can call it you you can call it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how would you vote against nature it's a sexual preference'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you can call it whatever but we we have natural inclination towards certain body types or certain type of person and that could be part that could be a certain ethnicity and it it and there's no harm in that because your personal choice but what i'm saying is discrimination is not necessarily bad in that matter right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'certainly but but the difference is that these laws are set in place for the history of hiring people without the laws and you didn't put restrictions in place i mean people of you know minorities or elderly people or people with disabilities they're not going to get hired at an equal rate as other people so i mean the the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'protections that these laws are in place are in place for a reason because historically it was harder for certain people to get hired and without the laws it would still be that way in a lot of situations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so it seems like you know a lot of a lot of emphasis is being put on protected characteristics of like you know oppressed groups and groups who have been previously discriminated against but would you say that maybe by not allowing discrimination if we started putting laws in place against all forms of discrimination that those groups would be would no longer have safe spaces for even themselves because that itself would also be discrimination'",
        "'speaker_3': 'should HBC us historically black colleges and universities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be forced to hire white teachers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and or or in social sciences where where the predominantly eighty percent women should we have quotas areas to make it fifty fifty or in the marketing department so the HR departments around the world where it's predominantly female should we have quotas here as well to sort of what i'm trying to say is that can we push it too far have we have we pushed it too far because right now we are at the point where we are sort of making it very tough for the so-called majority or the white people or the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'white straight male'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's important to constantly push the boundary on you know on that because the alternative is to relax the standards and you know and and that would be regressive and that would go back and i think we've come a long way in the hiring practices and i think that for the most part we're pretty positive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know for that people won't get discriminated against on you know you know their race or their age or you know they're physical ability and i think what we're talking about for this for beauty or you know for attractiveness i you know i think a lot of ways too like you know there's there's some customer facing positions and then for every company there's also you know a position where where you're looks wouldn't matter as much like for instance as a hostess you might want'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of you know if for every hostess that they hire there's also a job in the back of the kitchen that is washing dishes or whatever so i don't think it's it's right to be turned away just basically based on your appearance alone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'defibrillation has has always been and always will be we are just not talking about that you know and we are not discussing it we are not formalizing this you know in policies and everything it's there they're just trying to to to to stop noticing it and pretending like yeah they're all diverse and they're not discriminating but we are discriminating in fact and every stage of our lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to to to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but here is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'including personal life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we had a thought so so if if someone is is physically more sort of pleasing from the general society standards there are certain jobs that they are better off and they are of course there are a lot of other jobs that other people can do it someone like me was not so sort of pleasing on the eye i'm i'm sure would it be fine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly using anthony 's point for every job that is customer facing there's also one in the back so if you don't fit the appearance that i want for a customer facing person maybe i will hire you for a job that's in the back that less people are seeing but i'm allowed to discriminate for that first position if i want to because it is what will help my business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'without infringing my sort of freedom'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so but yeah but i i understand why the law is in place too because for you know i think there's certain certain scenarios where you know employers might you know you still have discriminatory discriminatory hiring practices on people based on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's always going to be some sort of discrimination for example if if i'm an investment bank i don't want to hire someone who adds a low IQ or has low analytical skills where you're gonna draw the line somebody 's gonna say ohh because i didn't go to a certain university or didn't have certain education that's why i didn't get hired yeah exactly that's why you didn't get hired because you didn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i know what you're saying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and and and and and if i'm i'm running a business i want smart people who have good analytical skills who and and if if you went to an ivy league that doesn't necessarily mean that you had better education it just means that they're vetting system is so strong that i can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'presumed that the people who end up there would have something special'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so a discrimination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the commitment is unfair recruitment is unfair everywhere to be honest and video even like i university recruitment this is a little bit tricky in that because we are looking for diversity and everything but sometimes we can just recruit students'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's not bad'",
        "'speaker_4': 'complying with that diversity diversity we want to show and that's why we need to to recruit or admit students with the low academic rates for example which we don't want to and those students are not doing quite well this is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but that's that's that's that's that's not the perfect solution because if if someone is struggling academically the worst thing you can do is put them with the ultra smart people who's gonna just make them feel miserable about themselves because they're competing against the best of the best we should have alternative education systems so we can put those kids there who are not sort of good at cramming stuff so they would have some other sort of career paths so discriminating and sort of having that thing it's not necessarily a bad thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'combination discrimination overall is a bad thing just society accepted it as a an unspoken through you know so it is there but we don't talk about it you know we are kind of pretending it's not there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now if there's a malice behind it but if if if if it's for it it's for it's for their own good or like just just how things work then i think it's it's alright'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you're saying there should be exceptions for when there's no malice behind it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah for sure if i if if i if i'm a manager of a football club and someone comes with a positive body image i won't let him in i would say no it's like i'm i'm there to win i i i'm not there to fix a society it's issues or your personal self esteem issues because you you're not fit to play i would rather have someone who's fit and who's gonna sort of run his ass off on the field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly that doesn't mean that i don't think that you couldn't be good for other jobs or that you shouldn't be able to find employment elsewhere or in that we shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then i'm telling you at any less than other person or you should be just not respected as the next person but i'm saying is that you're not fit for this job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're just not qualified to do the the the work on the field'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah or or anything or or or the type of job that i'm offering i find another person more suitable that doesn't mean that i don't like that individual or a group'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i totally agree with what you're saying there that's that's true i i understand that but then who is actually to judge to say if what you're doing is merit based versus you know if you do actually have a discriminatory you know practice in place who's actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the last thing i want is is the government to tell me what's good and what's bad because that's a very risky game to play we should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i agree there i don't think the government i mean the government 's not very good at doing a lot of things and being in charge of this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if you're giving them too much power and that's that's a very risky game to play in the long run so we should as a society'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it's really i understand less government power is definitely a good thing i think we can all agree on that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i totally agree with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we should have all by the society and just uh i think i think instead of focusing on these things and and sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because i i'm i'm let's say i'm i'm i'm a muslim i grew up as a muslim i'm not a practicing muslim anymore but that's besides the point i could have been very easily victim of that sort of victim mentality and feeling sorry for myself and and and and that doesn't help anyone and had to sort of grapple with this whole idea and i saw a lot of friends who would just whinging about it and just complaining about stuff it's it's it doesn't help anyone and i think it's just just too much i think in western countries'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for sure yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we are at a very good place i'm sure there are issues and there there are business and i can see it even in my social interactions i can see when they are they hear about my name or like my background and they make certain assumptions but it doesn't necessarily help anyone to sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh what we're talking about here is definitely a western you know an issue i think in other parts of the world'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it was their concepts yeah absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there are other parts in the world i think it's a much you know lesser issue i don't think they've gotten to the point where they're dealing with this problem where they consume this yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they don't even care about this stuff they they're they're more worried about surviving their day and that's about it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this isn't what you would call a third world problem'",
        "'speaker_3': 'although i would i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that the discrimination itself is is for sure still a world issue i think that in the west we probably talk about it a lot more but that definitely doesn't change how you know brown people people of color people who are oppressed overweight people are still treated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'outside of the west'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but how far can you take it so for example personally for me i didn't grow up in the west so i've i've lived in south asia i grew up there and when it came here like like i would see those sort of frictions and i would see people being slightly off but i can do anything that you guys can do or like any white person and there are a lot of good people and and i have all the opportunities it's just i shouldn't be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like pushing it too far that that sort of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because in just just just DNA it's like like a white guy is not able to even have opinion before he's slapped with ten labels or you're sexist you're better hierarchy and bah bah bah and i think we are pushing it too far that's my only concern because we we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i know what you're saying there yeah i know what you're saying with that what part of asia where what country were you actually from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm from pakistan'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK yeah so i mean your your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i take a lot of boxes so and with with the name so you you can see you can see what i grappled with but but it's it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK like like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your experience isn't definitely gonna be different than other people 's across the you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for sure for sure for sure and then i'm not complaining about it and i think it's it's a natural evolution and people for for a for everyone who has been rude to me there has been ten very kind human beings so it sets off and we cannot change everyone enforced laws and just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think we would just need to chill a little bit and not sort of criticize everything and not everything is bad and we shouldn't deconstruct everything and put everything out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know the more we're talking the more i'm tending to agree with what you're saying there i think that is actually a good outlook to have on life that's probably i think if people would relax a little bit more i think it would solve part of the problems here that we're talking about today'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because because this work culture is not helping anyone it's just taking it too far it's taking it way too far and and and the people they are supposed to represent the minorities we we we just don't want it anymore we like till we we don't need this like it's not it's not a zero sum game we just need to be kind and respectful and i think going too far left is as bad as going too far right because because you're imposing your views on others and you're not you just lose empathy you're not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're just sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'imposing your views on everyone here like uh you're a bad human being because you're not a vegan and you're destroying the environment or you're not body positive or you no i'm just there's just a dumb person who's trying to live his life just let it be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i totally agree with you yeah yeah you know nowadays we just used to label everything you know your book bag you're good or you you need to do that you don't need to do that and you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and in the name of empathy and then we and that's that's horrible that's horrible cause because they say are you don't care about transgender people or you don't care about brown people or black people no i don't like i i don't see it that way it's just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the normal way i think so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that even even if you do if if you do see it that way because we can only see things through our own lenses so we only know like our own struggles i i feel like the going too far slapping all these labels on every altercation every conversation you have with a person and they say something you don't agree with making these strong assumptions and opinions off of what you think is just a bad take or something that you disagree with from another person'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it creates this space of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it says there's friction and hatred yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'false wokeness'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of people who who say all the right all the politically correct things that but they don't really care and it doesn't really matter they don't mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'anything they don't really have the empathy that they are portraying we've almost manufactured it at this point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it says a lip service and moral posturing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah totally agree with you uh anthony you guys have any closing remarks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but when it comes to the beauty you remember the beauty in the eyes of the beholder so you know for some it's we are all different and we have preferences and companies that have preferences and it just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that's why my mother thinks i'm really pretty so there's that you're right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's that's good but you know that bad and that's why you're privilege you know i'm sure you as opposed you would have been discriminating people but for the name of the business like you always say right but it's also your personal preference you have to admit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i'm just playing devil's advocate so don't hold it against me yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but not accessing me and obviously i'm a little bit hurt when my best friend was looking for a job in finance i couldn't get it with his two twenty plus plus years of very high finance position just because he is in this we should not send an acceptable but once again you know it's western world we're living in west'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and also like there's another aspect to it like this health aspect to it so if i'm getting out of shape i would expect my friends to say that man you need to work out a little bit and i think if you are too overly sort of politically correct and no one is highlighting any bad habits we we can all use honest friend or like if people are like bullying is another thing but but it it's OK to sort of criticize'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you definitely need to support and encourage your friends yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'your friends'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's also a difference between discrimination based on you know unproven unprovable preconceptions and discrimination based on actual facts and characteristics you know the idea that someone can't do this job simply because they're fat and therefore they are lazy is not true you're not automatically lazy because you're fat so the reason that i'm discriminating also is extremely important'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's that's that's true but but but it it you have some physical limitation so if if you are obese sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i'll just go back to what i what i originally said in at the beginning is that a hiring decisions on physical appearance will definitely lead the missed opportunities for hired qualified candidates who's who might not fit the exact specific requirements you were looking for in the jobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and in most most industries yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah in most industries especially in fashion industry and furthermore it's also gonna lead to a lack of job satisfaction among the employees who feel that they're not hired or promoted based on you know their qualifications and skills and that overall is going to lead to a you know a worse you know job environment so i think it's important for companies to create a positive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and three how how much of it is you think is conscious and how much of it is us just being humans and unconsciously sort of we favor like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well humans definitely have an innate nature to you know have discriminatory you know i think everyone is just you know when they're born they're born with a you know a a little bit of a behavior of you know you know looking at people and seeing people and seeing you know is that a safe person is this a you know a dangerous person i think that everyone has that you know a little bit'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and we have serotypes and it it so that's how our brain functions i think the the key is to sort of highlight that we have this propensity and be conscious of it as much as we can while we are recruiting someone'",

        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
