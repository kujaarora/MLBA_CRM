        "'speaker_3': 'because again'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually you you you made a good point though but you said the dot you said the doctors i mean you go to your GP what what does your GP now about what weight issues or know about your GPA is just a general practitioner they've got no expertise in that so they my GP for instance i had when i was small he had like a you know he was a chainsmoker junk food detail so he couldn't advise'",
