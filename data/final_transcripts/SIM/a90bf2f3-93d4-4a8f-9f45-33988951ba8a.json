        "'speaker_4': 'and you can you can have your choices and like uh but instead of texting it like it it can be like a minor point but as i said like i also have seen a lot of these examples as well that's why i would say that it's hard to steal hard to judge by social media'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
