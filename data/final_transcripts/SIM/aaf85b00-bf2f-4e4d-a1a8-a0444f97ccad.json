        "'speaker_3': 'well i made fifteen'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but the thing is i know the business the business the business people have been saying that but the thinking is if the the the wage is raised that means it is stimulate more consumption and if more consumption is stimulated then you also make more money right the business will make more money and they have to pay more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah but it it it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it will happen sometime later like it it's a long process of you know how first they're getting paid'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but the thing is the business people yeah and the business people city of their business but think about the humanitarians from the humanitarian side like thinking all the people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but who like what is what has to be done business people do you think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's what i was gonna say yeah totally'",

        "'speaker_3': 'no you're totally right the humanitarian side of this i mean do you really think that people in corporations they have a lot of people in there telling them what to do what not to do and try to save money and everything like that but this seems to be at a state and government level problem so i don't really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know i i live in one of the worst red states so it's not like everything here is horrible to be honest uh republicans it's it's just off'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well you heard about moving to a different one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes i have but i'm thinking about all sorts of stuff i don't know it it's just an awful place my my idea there's like one or two good candidates they but it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'damn it needs a whole overhaul and just studying like the you know cultive personality and everything politics it's awful but i was making like fifty'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah people are not bad but they don't have a voice you know if you don't have a voice even if you're a good person then it doesn't really help and and i i i'm thinking for example if there was a like a top politician who can make things happen if they have their their daughters their sons receiving a minimum wage do you think they will speak the same language'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it too'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well that's why i was wondering like why is this a state level issue and government level issue like i said it started out with labor unions so everyone everyone of us is working'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh and like what can the unions do labor as in general labor labor laws and if you think about it'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right and the other thing is that there's like that you're right about the taxing but just to interject really quickly as we're supposed to there's also that thing of the politicians having'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everything 's become polarized so like what is the moral issue and raising the minimum wage there is none what is the the other than helping someone people and but they still want to do that and what is the republican reason for the not making taxes easier on the middle to lower class like it it's all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what what what will you should OK the the reason that the right will tell you that you know it infringes the freedoms of the'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah what we will what will happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's totally right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and and then the fear of like running out of business because you have to pay a lot of money i think it it's just it's unfounded it it's just a fear as it's been called it's a fear it's not something that will happen because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like even the the business that unless maybe some business of course some business maybe will will be out but we have to have a wayne you know if you are when things maybe a few business been out of like going out of business but the the what what level and all the the the condition of the people as a whole is improved'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right i doubt they'll go out of business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what now well let me disagree with you like i i know the like the the whole sector of business for example here is like you know food trucks and the food category and in general they operate on a very small you know profit margin usually like one two percent but it it's the best that they can do and that increase for for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's it's it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are you talking about small business though'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes yeah yes well well like food trucks or like some you know cafe or on the corner of your block or you know play'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh uh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're saying that they can't afford to pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no that like that's the the all all the saying like we kind of like doing it you know because we mostly like it and they increase in the minimum wage will yes it will it it will be fine for mcdonald's it will be fine for the big corporations but for the small business like that it it will be very much not fine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK maybe maybe OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's the thing OK so with all this debate and i agree with what you're saying so can we have a win win situation for example the minimum wage now is not like a blanket everyone will call it minimum wage minimum wage then is it can be categorized based on the industry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh yeah that's a good solution'",
        "'speaker_2': 'someone has it has to be willing to do something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right so they said like if you were a company that makes X amount of money then you have to pay your employees this money but if you don't make this amount of money then you have to pay your you can pay your employees'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes you are minimum wage is this one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no that that that's a reasonable suggestion yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right that's a solution that is a solution that's awesome'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because yeah we have the categories and the minimum wage is not like one blanket thing we just have it in you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but then it will happen like you know like the the jeff bezos space much less taxes because he doesn't have theoretically any income'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i guess it it will find out that amazon doesn't have any income and so it doesn't have to increase the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all because of those loopholes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because of the post'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well amazon is horrible for work or is some and some cases as i've been reading about like uh but what is what do all these billionaires and well we already know these moguls and stuff but they don't do much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they they have so many loopholes it's yeah it was so many loopholes they have of how they do their things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they they buy twitter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's why the willingness willingness to work on like to have other people 's best interest is is not there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so it sounds like the problem is all these loopholes if we cut out having all these loopholes for them to go back behind corners and you know cut corners and stuff then that would cut out half of the problem'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but there's a question like you know for example like fifty or sixty years ago it seems labor was pretty strong in in america in this country and the minimum wage was growing and you know minimum wage was growing till two thousand nine so yeah it wasn't great wage but at least there was something positive in increasement'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'will prices were a lot different then as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yes and then the price is so so what do you think has happened in in you know in two thousand eight two thousand nine that you know it's not growing anymore'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well they're also outsourcing jobs to other countries so that that cuts down on you know people being able to get jobs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it too'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so and they can pay people less in other countries so there's one last'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah for example manufacturing going to china it's because they want they want to pay less'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well true it's basically like it's it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh kind of like you know call center jobs that mostly go to india and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah they they are they also snapped and and you can see how the the the business the they are willing to do anything just to pay less i i i understand i understand from the point of them wanting to make more profit and being in business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i would say i'm more on the humanitarian you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sight and i think they should also think about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'say'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the employees because let's assume today business that has all the money in the world but they don't have a single employee will that business be there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly the employees are the employees uh top down and bottom down they're really the ones that are carrying most of the work of us CEO and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it won't be there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah they're making things happen'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and and they also they're customers like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but also you can see like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'he even customers customers want to be there if employees are not the employees they are the center of everything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right and what if what if you're like upset it even goes into customer satisfaction if PF CEO are so worried about customers as faction if a person is stressed and it has like a small amount of cash and is working their butts off just for nothing they may be you know not very nice with customer or something like that it even goes down to that level like i mean people have a lot of stress trying to get money and everything and the person at the top will probably not have as much stress though'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it didn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we see them as having a lot of stress but it's not the same cause like a family that is making a small low income is gonna be really stressed or gonna have less opportunities it's it's awful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah if the stress you know of course as you saying the stress is different because someone at the top maybe they are stressed because they're they're maybe there are couple of coffee was not made right but it's a different stress with someone like me who receiving the minimum wage and it's my child is sick i cannot take them to the hospital i cannot take them to school'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which is it's very different kind of stress'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i know and so like how can we look at the CEO making a bunch of cash when we're over here like i didn't have money i finished college but it took me eight years because i didn't have money to buy books and like the CEO i studied some other way but CEO corporations like and they're not approachable like it's just the corporate world how are why would they listen to someone struggling so it's like someday we'll all be really successful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what will but the idea at least you know be before they were listening to people who are struggling because the struggling people who united and putting pressure on them as a as a either further labor unions or the political movements and things like that why do you think they're not doing it now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but let let me ask you a question why uh labor unions not allowed in your state'",
        "'speaker_1': 'maybe there are those again instead like like they are theoretically allowed but they're they're are laws against like there there are loans for for example when labor unit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'laws against it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and the people who make those laws it's because they they feel that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but like all people all people who work in the company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the labor unions have the the the labor unions are becoming strong'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now we we are republic we are we are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the the we are republican state and they're the that's that that's why they put it a lot of effort in you know well they they're selling it as you know for example tendency is rather not the greatest state and not most famous one and not very attractive one but these laws that prevents labor they will bring more companies to our state so they will pay more taxes and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly and and then you see you see where the incentive is because the state will want to kill the labor unions because they want to to attract investment but the the behind what the effect that is happening is just the the employees are becoming weaker and then this is another loopholes for people who are up there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are you saying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it looks like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the are you saying well i i i really don't get that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's because like you know the the businesses businesses don't don't like work as union because workers union fight for for the rights of the the employees right so they don't like them because they challenge how things are happening in the in the in the business and so a state put in some of the rules and then hindrance and things like that it it will attract more companies to go to the state because they know they won't have workers union they don't have anyone watching their back and saying things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're saying there's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which which part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK i see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah this is good and and the people who are making these rules to weaken the workers union is because they are benefiting from them being weak'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i believe this is what happened when the the the minimum wage started'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'still like started to to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'feed and and not like there's no improvement improvement in because you know the improvement was there i think you said until twenty two thousand nine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when the the the people in power realize that the workers union being more powerful and they're demanding things and things are happening and then that's when the rules started coming'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no they they realized it long time ago it just it's a long process of you know squeezing them out yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of making rules right to weaken them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they succeeded'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true but do you know at the same time you know two thousand nine it's an obama'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so theoretically you know we were getting out of the economical crisis and things looked really bright then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that that was the last time that it has increased and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well well it looks like in november this was signed in tennessee so it was like recent also where the amendment was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well that this is the very recent one there were several before that kind of like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'making it hard it harder to unionize'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wow that's really bad this also wonder if has anything to do with like property ownership cause'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everything 's horrible long'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know what i'm talking about it's just awful like why but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know what is tennessee 's major export do you said it was food trucks that can't be possible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no my major expert no actually major expert i think music'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh well darn well yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah well well but but i i'm not very sure about that no but there are a lot of like it's kind of we have run the central location so we have a lot of warehouses and there is a lot of logistic companies for example here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but you know you know the other thing the other way you can i'm trying to think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for example the government you know the government spend a lot of money in warfare right they pay you know the the stamps and the food stamps and all these other medicare and all these things they pay because people cannot afford the things right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't you think if they they raise the minimum wage they will lower the amount they spend on welfare'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and less'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah well that that's usually one of the argument for the minimum wage that but but then you know it's it's kind of there is a balance here who needs to pay for the more poor people in in in your society it should it be business or should it be government'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'government'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i think united states in general moves to the that government'",
        "'speaker_3': 'small government i guess i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then then that's why they idea is for example for universal basic income it's kind of in the same way that you know the employee does need to pay them because government gonna pay them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'great'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but the government can lower its bill by offloading to the business some of it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right making a families have more sustainable income and having a living wage is the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because if they they raise they raise that way you little bit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'point there i guess'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they are going to offload the welfare bill to to the business so they kind of share'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well well no but but politicians like they don't own the government so it's kind of they're not really interested in you know how much government spends because it's not really their money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course yeah probably it's actually it's actually our tax it's it's our money right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well it's just awful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's the that's the thing we are revolving around the same thing of willingness someone out there has to be willing to deal with this thing and the ways will be found even in so involving the the the same same people who are paid'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohk OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'minimum wage they will tell you the solution and several solutions and you can evaluate which one works it's it's the willingness that is missing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right and if we can't get them by appealing to anyone 's like moral or humanitarian side there has to be some kind of you know they use loopholes we have to have some kind of loophole maybe some kind of it's gotta work guys we have to raise this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what what but let me give you a count argument against the minimum wage exactly through the labor from the labor perspective and that you know by the minimum wage kind of you know capitalists kind of trying to decrease the pressure inside of the society so in this way if we if the minimum wage will not race or it will be abolished for example there will be more and more desperate people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i feel the same too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and more and more desperate people would be more kind of eager to do with things like revolutions overthrowing everyone and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'everything that usually comes to that so that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you're saying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that argument is against the the wage raised ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it will be yeah kind of the worst the better argument'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm well that doesn't make any sense ohh like it the way that the minimum wage was was like post depression stuff so i mean if we didn't have even the minimum wage law it would be awful on workers cuz i study work work sychology so i mean like it was all terrible'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no well yes no but but but that's the point it will be horrible and workers and there will be much more willing to uprise and you know to to change the system in general'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no uh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm a bit but i i don't think it ever works'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no who who changed the system'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well uprising workers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm sorry oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like i i don't think it will happen but you know there there is such line of float'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and of the worse the better'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't understand the tip part it was like two point thirteen or something like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when what are those like what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't remember getting a flat rate i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i i think there was an exemption in the minimum wage laws except for for wages so that the most of their payment most of this kind of income will come from the tips'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not through the employer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is weird'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh like when you work at uh some kind of place i've seen this i've heard about it so people they have a tip jar or something like that and then they all get from the same tip and then you get like two dollars per hours or something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i didn't know that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it it depends sometimes it individualized sometimes it's their sharing their tips but but at the same time like i know lot of people like bartenders for example they get rather decent money especially if it's a friday or saturday'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that's it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but this is very i i'll say my experience probably this is very rare i don't have a lot of experience there it it's very rare and it depends with so many things depends on the kind of business depends on the economy like overall economy because you at this time people don't even go to to drink like for example what happens with kovid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well true true then everything is closed then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everything is closed then no tip nothing and and also the the the tip i believe tip works maybe probably in the in the in the alcohol bars and and some sort of nightclubs but in many places i don't think the tip works that well i usually see those jazz and they will have some coins and and the door and the two dollars i don't believe that yeah in in some i think probably in the nightclubs it might work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i wonder if we'll have to start training families to become bartenders because i mean like are we all gonna have to become bartenders that we can make a lot of cash that'd be you know that could be a thing just to train people for other stuff and i don't know that's something interesting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and lots of tips today'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we'll we'll we'll guys i think i i think we we we talked a little but arlene please talk to us a bit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh i'm sorry umm what would be my thing is what would be a good rate what would be a good minimum wage because i'm a massage therapist and i paid thirty dollars an hour plus tips and sometimes that's still not enough for me to make ends meet so what's the most who's how are we gonna agree on what's comfortable for everyone'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's a good question'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know OK in number that came into my mind'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then it it will what what do you think it should be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'did we go by industry or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'first of all by industry is by industry makes sense'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well now it goes by by kind of by the locality'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but now now it goes but locality like by the state or some states have you know different minimum wages in different counties'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know california does and well and it makes sense because the living wage is very different there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but we can we can do both you know you can go by state and within the state you can go by business'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but if you notice every time minimum wage is increased a little bit so is living so it it's never it's always uneven it's it's you can you can never make it at the end of the day'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have to figure out or i have to research i'll research why that is cause'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you you you you can't like it it has to be increased from time to time it's not like increase once and then stay there i i believe every it has to be reviewed or maybe every two years it has to be reviewed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yeah we have inflation so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you're right i mean just yeah there's all kinds of factors going in there and you're right like it it making any struggling to make ends meet is not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's it's everywhere and it's like really frustrating but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know what to say about that one it's a it's a state like if you live in an area like it's gonna be the cost of living is different'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everywhere so that's a huge factor in all that it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but do you think the the you know cost of living in different locations that it's kind of it makes you to choose location if you cannot afford to live in san francisco you know you move somewhere'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is is is that is good but how many'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you don't have to keep leaving there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but everything has gone up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'especially lately'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but why should people have to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but it's gone up not even there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why should people have to live in lesser environments just because they don't make enough you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's like elysium'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and and and and that means you'll find people that have low income it is happening within the state but also we'll find now state to poor people and state to reach people and that's what will happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and when that happened and we have even more big problems because now you have isolated people and put them in this one place'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but you can say it it always have been like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and what if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it has been yeah even within the state we have poor community and rich community and very rich communities'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the gated communities that for some reason bill gates and you know keeping everyone away'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and you have seen you have seen how bad it is right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everyone deserves a chance at the same things really but if you it making things more equitable but i would sincerely and i forgot if you think about it like causation doesn't mean causality or what is it correlation is not causality correlation i forget they're not whatever so i was just wondering like in an experiment is two things it's a cost of living does it really go up once we raise the minimum wage would have to check that out next is it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correlation there because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it it it does'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not one or the other because of that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it it might it might because the consumer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but like he he said goes like one to one not necessarily but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i know lakes it's not a cause it's not a cause'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah not but but it will because if if people have more money then they will spend more and when they spend more things get you know we we have we have scarcity of things because people get to buy them when they're gone and then they start the the prices start rising and that's how inflation happened right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'more expensive yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right so i think that we should do a little or i'll do it some research on that factor to see if that is just rhetoric or if it's really something that's correlated the next thing is if the government just puts out a law that they do have to do it and this is on the government level let's see what really happens to companies sure some of them will like you said we'll have to do that thing where it's by company if it's a small business they're on a certain tier maybe and so on but what would really happen i just wonder like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know you're right fear is a huge'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hit a impediment to changing things so what will really happen i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hector'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because if things if things can even start with taste like start with the state one state let's do a pilot with with one hand let's do pilot with one state'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah let's do my hey that's a good idea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but i think california does it like california has it that they have fifteen they raised it to fifteen and they're trying to play in where their laws yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and what happened'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and because phone is driving right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean it works to certain degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what happened there and when did they do is when this happened'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what's happened with california'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well well one thing that has happened that some businesses survived and now they have fifteen dollars minimum wage the same time like again as a person from east tennessee we have a lot of people immigrating from california here mostly for that reason that they cannot afford'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i i don't i believe people migrated because because of the the the confident confident open the remote work of course yeah yeah people who want to come and stay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'california'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it it it's much cheaper to live here like the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i understand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it it's cheaper because they also want more money but if it's not for confident remote work do you think they were going to to leave'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're going to stay there and they can afford'",
