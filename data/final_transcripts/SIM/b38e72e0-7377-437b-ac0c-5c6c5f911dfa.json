        "'speaker_1': 'excellent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK great then uh who would like to start'",

        "'speaker_4': 'OK perfect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there are many institutions here in the united states and unfortunately this tendency is spreading abroad'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that higher education colleges and universities are getting very expensive and just from an economic standpoint the the the investment one makes in tuition and books and and moving away'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean if you're if you're training if you're if you're looking for a job so many so many so many college degrees so many colleges can't college campuses these days are not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's just not worth the investment and the time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with michael i am from germany and here is the same situation even though education is for free here it is still a lot of time that goes into getting a degree there are lots of exams and lots of legal procedures and at the end when you look at the people who get hired especially in some civilian job fields we can easily see that it does not necessarily depending on the college degree as a person he worked in the IT'",
        "'speaker_3': 'back there i think it is one of the fields that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm anybody can get in without any degree of because it is it can be self taught and i think there are many other degrees that has the same'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry not the degrees but the job qualifications that one can get easily by doing a lot of courses online by'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just doing experience doing like projects in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'internships in this kind of stuff and they can get more experience on what they're doing rather than just doing some exams just for the regulation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so in that sense i i cannot imagine how how worse it is to actually pay for such thing in such high fees in and at the end it is still not very relevant either you're getting a job or not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good point i you know those are very very good points on the negative but i'd like to have some input if that's alright'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm on the pro side and you know a lot of this does come from experience and things are changing in the world but in my experience as i've continued my education i've been able to get better jobs where i got paid more and i worked less i mean i feel like it wasn't manual hard jobs like retail or food service i got to work as a professional in a professional environment and you know maybe it was hard because i had to use some of those skills i got in school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i think that every time that i got in those positions the career positions that was my sweet spot and i really feel like the education prepared me for that at the beginning i had to get grants and you know grants i didn't have to pay back but then after that i was talked into student loans because i'm just kind of a nerdy person and i like school so i got the loans and you know the first half of my life was rough because i had this loan i had to pay back and it just seemed like it was so much i think it was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'less than ten thousand dollars but it was for a bachelor 's degree but you know it was in radio and television so i got to work in TV studios i had the funnest time and i got to meet people i got to be in leadership positions managing TV stations i had so many opportunities because of my education i could move to a new job market go to the one ads in the old newspapers and look for career like professional positions i could just bypass all that retail food service all those hard jobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and go to the ones that you used my abilities to best so i'm i'm kind of pro but at the same time it depends and you know now i've gone even further with my education and you all have a very good point because education is ridiculously expensive i still didn't have a lot of money and somehow i ended up going back you know in my career positions i was able to pay off my student loan and it felt so good i built my credit i did all the things you're supposed to do in the american dream and then i went back to school after i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know lost that career position and ended up you know floundering around in the employment you know realm trying to find a job i went back to school ohh and i had advice from a family member you know go ahead you know get a loan you'll be able to get a better job and be able to pay it back well it's ridiculously expensive and now i have this loan that's more than all the property my husband and i own and it's kind of scary going back into the career field and now i'm older so you all are making some good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good points'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so yeah i sorry for interrupting i i i just uh catch something that he said he said that you work in the radio television and you got the education education on that but do you still had the work experience beside your degree right that's where you actually learn stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i did an internship and i really think internships are a good idea if you can get them getting out there and getting in the field because in my internship as soon as i graduated well actually i think it was before i graduated a student assistant physician opened so i got more experience getting paid and then when i graduated it did take like six months and that same company wanted they kept telling me oh we're thinking about you we want to bring you in they did it and i had this student loan i was freaking out and finally they did offer me that position i got to manage TV'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'videos i got to work for many many years doing that so you know it's those periods of time where you're kind of hanging and dangling and waiting for that next big opportunity you just have to survive until you get to that when you get the big opportunity you can get yourself where you need to be financially if you make some smart financial choices'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so as you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but also like you said that i said it was an internship so internship is still actually considered as experience rather than a degree itself so like here you also actually think then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh experience itself is better than the getting it just a piece of paper that's such as such as the agree and for you it was easier to get an internship because you would think that degree but also in the in the world that that we didn't need to have a education to get into some sort of job internship or like any kind of like a student job and we would actually be able to learn more on the field so you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or that is a very good point because getting the internship gets you the experience you're so right it's kind of like the cart before the horse because now i got that was my bachelor 's the radio and TV the masters degree was in education instructional design creating courses online but you know what i never got the hands on experience using these certain tools that major corporations and education institutions use they're articulating storyline and all of these and i've never gotten that experience so i just went back to school got my PHD and now i'm still trying to get in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i just blew off instructional design i never could get the experience so that's why you're making a good point on the experience tip'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and also in the other case that let's say that for example if you're working in some specific fields like a a medicine or some other jobs related to that area it it makes sense to get the degree but still i think when you talk to people who work in this area they will still say you that you learn most of the stuff after you stop working with the patient in these kind of sort of things so like degree is good when you learn about the theoretical side of the job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you're gonna be doing but at the same time it can give you only so much yeah exactly and i think i think the more actually we evolve in technology and such i think it is less important to have the degree and more important to be able to actually go out and learn stuff online there is so much information online and there's so many certificates and so many tutorials that are better than what you have around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'skills'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you you can go to the nearest college in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'nearest institute to learn stuff but then there there is a world beyond that and you will be able to access every single pupil online and they can give you the education that you cannot get near you so i think it is more important to have the experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it's not at the level'",
        "'speaker_3': 'especially if you're working in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'until you get a certification it's not at the level that it needs to be you know it's not going to be as professional if you get certification you get degreed you are tested and you can demonstrate your knowledge now the skills you're talking about like IT i'm finding a lot of technical people you know yeah and i've even found that in radio and TV they were technical and they said ohh the people that go to school they teach and the people that know how to do it they do it you know and they had a funny way to say it was like a poem but you know you have to get certifications even like some of this technology stuff'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'run'",
        "'speaker_1': 'IT you have to have certifications and you know it's kind of like education wouldn't you say or is that more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree but what i actually meant i i wanna be more specific on this because what i meant was more focus was more relevant to the field that i work IT so when you actually had the certificate it doesn't necessarily mean that you just you're eligible to work at this job because during the course during the the certificate you actually do a lot of projects that you can use later on to shrug your skill sets it's basically a way to get a skills in that area'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of course it depends on the which field you're working but especially in IT sector certificate doesn't necessarily mean a piece of paper it means that you learn these skills and then you can apply them to real life because as a person he also studied it in the uni i can say that actually they show you the technical side of it they show you the theory which is great amazing to learn but you will actually not use ninety percent of these information when you're actually working because it's all about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good boy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah but it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'working with the customer working efficiently working with the time and none of these actually are in the school none of these these will be taught maybe in some school projects it is the case but when you look at these like years like three'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah excuse me i i think michael wanted to chip in as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would just i just wanted to jump in that that is a lot of the the a lot of the certificates particularly if they're online'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah sorry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but good point though thank you yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they i'm arguing the other side now a lot of the certificates if they're offered online they they only can evaluate a certain small spectrum of of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of one 's skills when's knowledge ones experience the theoretical knowledge that yakima mentions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i i think when we you know we're we're talking a lot about IT and but to my mind there's there's a realm out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's being neglected particularly in the US where a lot of young people are sort of expected to go to college i you know i have it on good authority that a lot of these young people who are at the university or at college'",
        "'speaker_2': 'might might have might do better to look into a different career path and i find it i find it very interesting that yammer is from germany because i'm familiar with the system there with apprenticeships and a sort of dual education program that they have there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'brilliant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where where youngsters don't don't they don't need a college degree to get a really well paying job of rewarding career and i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'vocational right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah right and and some some youngsters are just not interested in in the theory they're not interested or have the aptitude to read these longer texts and analyze'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm they wanna get out there and do it i know when i taught i would tell my students course this was you know music video business but you know there were technical people until you're learning a lot of theory in class but when you get that job if your boss tells you to do it differently don't tell them my textbook said to do like this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah glitter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah uh yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but michael actually you're totally correct i think most of the german people right nowadays do not want to go to college even though it is for free we actually still think that there is a more value in the experience itself so the programs we have programs like a year or two years program where you actually work with the company and you go to the school maybe two or three days in a week and then the rest is on the field like whatever you're doing you are learning and putting it into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the real work at the same time like within the same week almost so it is actually very great and then working like doing this kind of thing for a year or maybe a year and a half will actually get you the same as the bachelor certificate or even more because then they will know that actually you have the field experience as well so lots of people do that because it is amazing opportunity and i'm glad that we had that opportunity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'equivalent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see and you like i said we actually get really good paid after that it is like great opportunity i think it can be used in different countries i'm not sure if it exists in the US but maybe it should be there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no i know i know some people who are trying to expand such programs here in the U S U M people talk about the labor shortage in the US and and people are unwilling to to take on these industrial jobs and and they pay very well and it's not they're not dead end jobs either with the way technology the way that technology is spreading you you have to you have to keep learning it's not as though you're you go into this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no not at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will those jobs be automated in the future if people aren't wanting to do it and it's it's real'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no that's a good question too but i think i think these people are learning'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at least a good ones who aren't stuck they're they're learning how to adapt to yeah programs in the factory that use AI'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and since i'm on the process here as well i i might add that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh and it don't you think that it's somewhat more important to get a a broad understanding or even feel for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'foundation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah for for for for the for the whole area before just jumping into one very specific job with a with well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'high skill sets'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know yeah with a with a very narrow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a set of skills and and expertise'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so uh to to to get a a broader uh feel first before jumping into one of those jobs to perhaps even make better decisions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's yeah that that's a very that's a common'",
        "'speaker_1': 'throwing them out to the lions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's a common criticism of the german educational system that they that they track youngsters quite quite early for example the field in which i work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i had no clue in high school or even at the beginning of college that i would be doing what i'm doing now i had very different plans very different ideas'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i'm very grateful i mean yes i i went to university i have i have advanced degrees and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean i'm just i'm just one dot on the big anecdotal data scale but uh i think there are many examples out there of of people who shift career and having'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and having having a broad foundation can certainly be a benefit now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you never know where you're going to end up and you know a lot of times you all feel like it's a who you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because sometimes you know you have the qualifications but if you don't know people they can't put in a word for you but once you get the job the who you know is not gonna help at all you know you it's the rubber reads the road you have to either be able to do it or you're out of there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i also i also think that actually college is beneficial but it depends on the person like a if the person can take up all the information that is given to them and then not just thinking about the passing the course and getting degraded and it's definitely hundred percent beneficial thing to go to college and it is maybe worth the money but i feel like actually most of the people are focused on getting a degree and getting a job immediately so if this mindset changes then it can be the other way around maybe the action they college can give more to students than the experience itself'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'really good point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what i see from what i see from my education i am doing my math is that now and it's the same thing there like even from the first day people are asking each other where we can lend after getting a degree so it's it was very annoying for me to actually start it again and hearing all about these and like people actually don't do the degree just to learn about that they do it to get a job at the end of course there should be the one of the goal but why is it actually main focus that's actually one thing that i had in my mind for the longest time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm thinking degree and i'll enjoy the process but i think it is it's also completely normal to actually think about what's gonna happen at the end you don't wanna invest your time and money yeah to something yeah exactly but i think just the system in this case is a bit different i think the college can be very good if it is using the correct way i would say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the brick wall'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a good point you know it has to be relevant i had to go back to school because you know i had radio TV well that's old news you know now everything 's technology digital so i was like i need to go back to school to keep up with the kids and i learned all about the internet education technology is what i focused on so i feel a lot better about my future which i think before maybe i would have started thinking about retiring already'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'despite the huge debts yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i can just live on i've made a lot of money in my life my social security 's gonna be pretty good and you know we had a lot of land and we have a lot of investments so i can pretty much go and retire in the garden if i want but i feel like i still have something left in me to give to the world and i love working you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's great yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh that's that's really cool yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's great'",
