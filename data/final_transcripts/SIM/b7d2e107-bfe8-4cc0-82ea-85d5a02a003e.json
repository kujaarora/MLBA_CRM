        "'speaker_1': 'a quick brown fox jumps over the wet lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cool'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",

        "'speaker_2': 'JP'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cool OK so you guys'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are aware of the topic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i can i can repeat it for you if you want and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we will assign one person to speak in favor and two against it should the minimum wage be increased just minimum wage at all companies to take advantage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all of their employees so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh georgiana you can speak in favor and saksham and JP could you please speak in against it and i will be jumping in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whenever i feel the need to sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'keep it rolling uh georgiana would you like to make an opening statement'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess it's basically'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and a lot of people get stuck in minimum wage minimum wage jobs for their whole lives and and if the minimum wage is the smallest amount that people think they should subsist on you know and it should really not be having people where they're living on the edge of poverty i guess that would be a good baseline is raising people away from poverty'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes you got anything yesterday'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well it can cause like inflation if more people have more money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those jobs become more competitive and companies might even want to cut down on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh jobs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because because it costs too much to have them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you're saying so that the companies are not exploiting people on minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i have i have to be against it right but yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can play with the devil that you can come on you can be politician for the day'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would like to add something to what GGP said actually it actually leads to reduction in the employment because because of the increased labor costs and slim profit margins that might force business owners to cut their stuff'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that's one of the problems that might arise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you're saying that we're better off having lower wages and more employment that's the trade off your talking about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i would say yeah i would be in favor of that right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i think i've read research that UM that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'believe and i'm completely making so by the way but it's OK i've read research that we believe that increasing minimum wage doesn't actually kill jobs because it boosts the economy and backchanneling more pay to to kind of lower paid workers who then spend that money so you're basically putting money into their pockets which then goes out and boost the economy in general overall'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no it's not actually made up stuff it's it it makes sense because there's more circulation of money and it it it's it's in more pockets it makes perfect sense'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK there you go well that's yeah i was making up the research but yes thank you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but if we had had a had a fair point at it sort of increases inflation but inflation is not necessarily a bad thing because it means just people have more money to spend'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh to a bit of inflation is good probably'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it does uh yeah i would uh but at this point i i can't agree with georgina but the thing is when we go for some lower skilled workers who or maybe we go for some inexperienced workers they increasingly minimum wage would actually diminish the value of hiring because you know as business owners may find it more cost effective to hire a high paid experience worker to invest in machines and technology so you know maybe maybe go for these machines and technology rather than just you know hiring some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'lower skilled worker who has you know a hiked minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so but what will how how is it different than running a sweatshop then because you're paying them and exploiting them you're being competitive but you're not paying enough so if someone is earning let's say a million dollar or like a even billions then isn't it unfair for someone like jeff bezos to pay someone less than let's say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a certain minimum threshold'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh it actually it right that that is this scale which you're talking about if you go to jeff bezos scale it's actually really really big scale i mean it's in terms of billions of dollars what i'm talking about is actually workers who have actually run local shops who have their business in a local area so that is where my point actually comes into play like that rather than increase having an increased minimum wage and hiring a low lower skilled worker'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they can actually invest into machines or technology so that's what my point was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's a great point actually and i think i think maybe even something that's important to look at with things like minimum wages is a company like like you say a smaller company an independent company versus a big company like amazon or or that kind of thing tesla and and and you can't really compare the two the difference of work between somebody who's running a shop versus somebody who's working in abysus as warehouse and the expectations and it's quite fast'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah not only that but if the minimum wage is increased unfortunately some businesses would would probably not be able to like pay workers so they might just go out of business like it'll it'll mess up small businesses so that's only to think about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right and actually comes right perfect perfect i agree with you GP because it directly comes to reduction in employment as we discussed as the first point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no but there's there's no strong correlation between employment and and for example the most of who who hires the most amount of people on minimum wage these are multinational chains burger king'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah but you can mcdonald's yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mcdonald's and then and primark in detects the holes are everyone so those guys are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'earning a lot of money and i'm sure they are they have a lot of money to spare that can be given to people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they are they are they are but the key to actually earning the money is because they have low cost products but they actually sell it in so large and a huge variety that is where they are able to earn the money that's that's where it comes into like you know that is the point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah that's a it's it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i we can talk about their business model but but they're still earning a lot of money right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i i think this is actually a really good point you you both right in a way but i think that what what you can talk about is maybe something like turnover would slow down you'd you'd get through less'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if you if you lower skilled workers because you'd be perhaps train them and you know people would be less likely to leave because they'd be happier with the work that that they're doing plus the wages they getting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that you become more efficient you can sell more units probably'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah so employees are more productive you know and happier'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then there is also like an ethical'",
        "'speaker_2': 'dilemma here as well like people should not be worried about making their ends meet on minimum wage and considering in most of the countries in europe now we have about eight percent inflation how do you sort of grapple with with surviving with on the same minimum page that was the year before or the year before because now everything is costing them eight percent more and their wage hasn't increased'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'isn't there a case for increasing the minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but yeah but the the the way the like the increase like year over year isn't like that high that we would need to increase it like like in the US what they're doing is seven to fifteen dollars like they did that in california a while back and that's just a huge increase like it doesn't match inflation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it does you know where'",
        "'speaker_2': 'get over how many years did you do this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think this happened just in twenty twenty two they just jumped from seven dollars to twenty to fifteen dollars'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there there there is another element to it because seven dollars for significantly lower than the rest of the world like minimum wage in in europe is touching eleven now so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this that so you guys were behind already'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so there is an inflation adjustment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but georgianna do you do you feel it it puts businesses in a tricky situation where they would might have to think about other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i think well i think i'm talking about the UK at the moment i don't know how well now this is across the world but yeah we're having constant strikes yeah and when they're strikes in about i don't know about six or seven different industries because people have that lowly paid you know and yeah they are compared to what they should be paid actually yeah i'm absolutely on the side of people striking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'waves'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah you guys are having quite a party there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i know people get mad about it but yeah no they they they they do really hard work and the pay is appalling and the money is there for them to be paid better it just goes to the the managers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is is is there is there because because because because you can't economically you you guys are struggling or or or your your argument is more towards how the the the money is sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well if if economically we were struggling the managers wouldn't be getting paid in like twenty million bonuses would they so you've gotta you gotta look at it that way it's like somebody should get paid and maybe it's not the one guy at the top who actually caused lots of problems'",
        "'speaker_4': 'strikes are from the public sector right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a lot of them not all of them but things like royal the the trains aren't public uh the postage service isn't public yeah so the NHS is public yes but the other two aren't though it's kind of a it is a mix'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah most of them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'actually i can also add one thing to it to that what we are actually talking about the minimum wage we are actually referring to right here would be for the people who are you know who do a jobs like maybe someone is a carpenter or maybe you know jobs like that they're work in a restaurant chain or maybe like you know as you were talking about burger king and all but this thing doesn't actually apply in india because if you talk about india here it's really been exploited i mean it's exploited a lot i mean people are not given'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what they actually you know should get like if for example if we talk about british pound british pound is around a hundred rupees for one pound one sterling but here like for for for just like that in the UK if somebody works in a mcdonald's they might get paid around eight to ten pounds per hour right but if you talk in india the same thing they're just paid around five hundred to sorry not five hundred it's around two fifty to three hundred rupees per hour that is two to three sterling pounds that's it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so it actually it actually differs what what which country which which target space you're actually talking about because in countries like india it is actually really being being you know exploited but in countries which are much developed than india which are already being developed just like UK or you maybe you talk about USA the situation is quite different'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but don't you think we should think about the cost of living as well because two to three pounds enable you to do a lot more in india than in the UK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh actually not it's not like that two to three pounds in india i would specifically tell you right now that's right we should we should keep standard of living in perspective'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can have a meal in with a couple of pounds right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right that that is possible that is that is still actually possible in india but if you go for you know some maybe a little more skilled jobs or maybe if you are actually work as an electrician or something it doesn't it doesn't actually apply as compared to other countries but yeah these are some of the factors which the public see there are a lot of differences between india and these developed countries because these guys do have these public transports being like that are developed we don't have that at much that much rate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do you guys think we should let it be or should the government step in and sort of have those laws to dictate how much what's the minimum wage for everyone'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do i have do i have to be in favor or against'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can go either way you can just keep the discussion going i can i can play the devil's advocate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what are you guys in favor of enforcing the laws regarding'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the minimum wage or are you guys off the view that the market should decide like the atoms with way of letting it be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i would personally say i would personally say that the market should decide'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and if the market decides that the minimum wage is two euros or whatever you'll be fine with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm well yeah at a point if i am you know myself indulged in it i might face some issues with that but to you know have a bigger picture for the economy to work as a whole to you know have employment to be there so we might have to just leave it to the market'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you're saying that people 's lifestyle is more important it's less important than the economy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as a whole'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm yeah yeah i think i i contradicted myself here but yeah i would agree with you that we should actually go with the people 's lifestyle that that's there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but if you everyone has the same lifestyle and everyone is getting a good salary what's there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for one person to work more or work harder because the reward is the same so why would he bother'",
        "'speaker_2': 'putting in extra work or working hard or more diligently'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'aren't you killing the incentive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who who wants to work hard come on when we're not here for that long you know let why why we working really hard for somebody else to earn lots of money maybe let us paid for just working'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we we we are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we at least need a minimum wage because like without it you know people could become slaves like working on one pound a day like in the future or something so that's definitely necessary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but but but my concern is like if if you don't have anything like in a good incentive for people to work hard or like work fairly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's not a good game to play either in the long run or is it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's a good point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's true there are a lot of jobs that aren't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'necessarily you know the kind of thing that you can i don't know i personally wouldn't get like a job fulfillment out of say emptying bins maybe some people would i wouldn't but if i got paid really well then i would be like happier about eighteen bins for example you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and still feel shitty about the job and but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes i'm saying you know some people might really like recycling it might be you know make make him feel good but it so it depends'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i have a i've worked at burger king and i now work as a financial analyst to be honest i was more more happy at burger king making burgers there's a lot more fun i wasn't getting paid enough but there's that that's i found my passion but in a very niche that wasn't paying so let the time so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will they get'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see so if you got paid better you could be happy if you'd been burgers right now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then then there is an element of social status as well like people sort of would look down on you and in in a way like we we all have that sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'longing to be validated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah people would actually talk that yeah that he's just making burgers and that's it that's what he does so that did they do talk about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'especially for someone like us who was from south asia and we'll make sure that everyone knows what are opinions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's actually a really big thing here it is actually really big thing here especially in india actually in south asia as a whole it is actually a thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think one thing that at least in england covid helped with is it made people realize that you shouldn't look down on people who i don't know worked in shops or in takeaways or whatever or or i mean it's not fixed but it's better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'george anna do you think it's it's it's it's true it like like we we say the right things like relatively most of the times but do you think ecore we we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we aren't sort of we don't have we have that still have that prejudice towards certain occupations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh i'm sure doug wrong sure lots of people do but i think generally the society some people improve let's put it that way i'm sure lots of people still judge because that's a hard thing to change'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and do you think it it it effects our behavior as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh absolutely there'll be people who treat people who like say waitresses or waiters they'll treat them badly just because they see them as serving them whereas you know they're not they're just new to the job so you definitely see it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and he even in in your private life when you introduce yourself or if you're dressed up you come you look like you work at an investment bank or something it doesn't it sort of effects the crowd as well the way they sort of treat you subconsciously or consciously'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh consciously yeah absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm i i used to work as a a program actually in in london and i used to work as a porter so like someone who carries like furniture in in london when i was in university and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'keeping'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry come again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so yeah i just felt like people would look down at me a lot a lot but i mean some people are nice and they tip tip you but you know the majority they just kind of treat you like you're dumb and it was just it was not a pleasant experience i'll tell you that but it's like it your intelligence does not like i have anything to do with what job you have i'll say that like there are a lot of smart people there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that this opportunities there there's there's it's it's a multivariate equation yeah sure do do you feel you would be would have been happier if you had like a higher minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh yeah i think so i mean at the at the point at that time my my dad was helping me with money and stuff too it's just for extra money but yeah i felt like i was also getting used too because i i wasn't paid for certain hours like going to work i'd have to take a two hour bus to london and i wasn't paid for that so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that felt wrong'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but yeah so maybe a higher minimum wage would have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i i think at the end of the day everyone wants to be paid higher most of our cycle unless we are very spiritual or i don't know but more most of us would like more money where where do we draw the line what what what's a good minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know people have talked about i think universal basic income i know they're a studies going on where they give you a don't know for example this is an example of that may i don't know the actual numbers like say six hundred pounds in england a month say and it's enough for your food and your rent and your bills and then you know anything above that you can work or not work or do whatever you want but that way the idea is that everyone would at least live you know you'd have you'd have your basics to survive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then you could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to the this the six hundred pounds it's it's what is the minimum wage or it's it's the government support'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no no i'm not making up it it it's basically just it's like it's like the government pays you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah OK cool i understand OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so basically universal minimum so basically every single person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think it would be adults have got to me i'm not sure if it can't for kids i don't know but the idea would be that every single person gets it so they know a hundred percent they're absolutely everyone has got food and shelter and you know bills paid and then after that you can work and it is basic you know you don't get any'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'give it six hundred in london'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm i'm making you hope i don't know what the actual number is they would be a a real number and and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what what would be your hunch like what what what what's a good number'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't actually know what the real life would be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i actually have a friend who has who's on universal income he gets the one thousand a month and he doesn't work well he does freelance so you actually get some extra money on the side but yeah in the UK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh there you go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the UK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'one thousand'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one thousand one and does is unemployed yeah almost jealous of him but yeah it's not that much but still he has a house and everything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no if if he has a side gig then probably sending more than you so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but the idea is it is a good idea i i really like the idea because it basically stops people getting exploited it stops people living in poverty because there's a lot of poverty'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no but what what about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so you're saying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well what his friend is doing is fine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or or better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no it's fine fine by me i'm not jealous just because he's got a i mean i i'd quite like that too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no but he's working on the side and and he's he's getting some money from the comment which should go to someone who is not able to work right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so the'",
