        "'speaker_1': 'you can continue with the debate if you like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK well i go back to the just because you can do something doesn't mean you should and i really do get concerned about the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the misuse of it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like if OK there's always thing everyone can misuse anything OK right right now let me just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree and like if you think about like media right now right accessible to everybody but it's it's getting used for a lot of bad things so at this point like newer generations of kids are getting affected a lot more they're mental health so like you said just because you can doesn't mean you should not being regulated we're not blaming the AI we're just saying that it like like everything else'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not the i fault it's the fault of the whole'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you said with with power you have to be responsible not everybody responsible so just because it's there doesn't mean it needs to be used by everybody especially if it's not being regulated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK it's the it's the that is a very common thing from the spiderman movies OK with big power curve big responsibilities OK so like but the AI what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well that's because it comes from something life'",
        "'speaker_3': 'after that so what AI can help is that it can eliminate the necessities from he wants to perform tedious task OK there are a ton of tasks OK which the humans are human they are very a ton of dangerous tasks with the humans are doing OK they are repetitive tedious task OK which is the main for many human workers around the world OK they are so boring there are a ton of mistakes if i bound to write later everyday there will be a ton of grammatical mistakes in the letters OK OK so in the task it is working as a great tool OK it is pointing automations OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah some sophisticated AI who can take care of whole plants machineries and then and freeing up human'",

        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_3': 'like there are there are ton of advancements OK like right now you can see the walls OK like there is a future predictions that the wars will be fight on AI OK the humans life will be saved OK what these things will do will increase the humans life expectancy by improving the medical advancements and take'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our science to the next level OK what they they are going to do OK there are some bad parts which are person can see that there is a ton of bad parts the little there's life is right now very suffering there is kind of a second universe or something i know there are digitally but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for people who have disabilities OK this is a god set OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but yeah i do i agree with that that there are certain areas where it is useful but it just to go back to the pharmaceutical industry if they've done one or two tests and maybe it works most of the time which you want them putting that out available to everybody'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they can't do that there is a DL restrictions over that you can't put my sense out there but what the AI can either seeing them in getting more complex molecules OK like if this is not working there will provide alternate molecules OK which size could take ton of years OK it is their job to ensure that proper testing and FDA approvals are taken before any drugs into that OK so it is there there's a ton of data abuse which is going on with because of that is banned'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but if the correct data is there OK i think they're bound to make good products OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but just there is a fear of job loss OK so at first there was a thinking that the AI will replace these manual jobs OK like in the factory workers gig workers and things OK but right now it's when the advent of AI happened they're bound to replace the creative jobs as well right now i can see that there are pictures made by IIS which are all over the internet which is very true OK like you can't differentiate whether it is a false image or not true image so that was that is there OK but it will create a ton of new jobs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK which will emerge on the basis of this OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but is it gonna give the jobs at the same people that are losing their jobs if you're working in a factory and the jobs that are opening are in tech the factory worker is not gonna be able to just move to a tech job i don't i don't think it's equal it might create more jobs yes but the jobs that they're eliminating are are people that are not necessarily in that field so how does that beneficial for them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK like this is something like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and all those all those bots online that like pretend they're they're influencers and stuff like that that's all also very bad i mean like on the in the overall scheme of things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is that but the thing is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and it's just nobody's regulated it it's just going it's like a free for all right now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but whenever there is a new technology there will be a ton of business let me tell you example of there was a horse cart owners in london OK there were horse cart owners when the advent of cars happened OK what happened did all they lose their jobs but there's moved on to a different category of income they sat and went into the car line something to do different things but right now there is no job as a house car driver or something like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but what if AI takes over all the industries then what jobs are left'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it can't take over the industry there is a decision making thing OK which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'people won't rely on AI OK you can make the ISV of company they are not yet developed and i think they will never well OK because the risk taking abilities OK which comes with the human willpower which which can never be replaced OK there is just one thing like there are like two three bad aspects which i do want to talk about OK there is like the thing is that they can augment human capacities OK but they will have a very deep dependence on the machine driven networks OK like visual erode the humans abilities to do things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hey like if you if you have an AI robot which is preparing meal every day OK there's a very less chance that you will prepare me yourself after a while OK you think OK he's making it OK let's leave it to them and after a while'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you will forget how to make meals OK because it is totally dependent on the one day that system will be broken and you'll find yourself helpless OK that this is not working how can i make a meal OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess i get concerned on the jobs front because in the past when there have been things that have taken people 's job advancements that took people 's jobs there were other opportunities they could easily walk into it's getting to the point where you you have to have specialized skills which requires an education or some kind of additional training that a lot of people can't afford so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it it concerns me to be losing that many jobs to what polly said to to people that maybe aren't prepared to do anything else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it created i mean like think about if you think about even now a lot of the people that work jobs are not living are not making a livable wage right because the cost of everything is going up and the salary that they're making is not necessarily going up and if if those are the types of jobs that are doing then the education is not as accessible because it costs money so in the overall thing scheme of things though it can be very helpful in a lot of different industries the way this tends to go is once it works in one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'still there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'everybody tries to abuse it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK that is there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the employer is just looking at that bottom line saving'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly exactly and who's gonna be buying medicine if nobody's working and can afford anything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK this is my one happening this is a broader aspect like there are temporary mishaps plot the industry OK but humanity as a whole will conquer through everything OK like if AI is having jobs they would be jobs to train AI people OK like there will be some miss happiness story you can be out of work for one year OK but next year you can open a stall food stall where you will make it flipping burgers and making more than what you are arming OK this happens with every'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for that one year who's gonna give them money to live off of how are they gonna pay for their bills and what about their children how about food gas health care i mean nothing especially here in the united states is free'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'healthcare'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right so health care is already like crazy expensive so then you're gonna take away his jobs and then you're gonna make him work somewhere flipping burgers then then what he does it doesn't matter how advanced medicine is if they can't afford it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm talking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what the thing is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK then the things are going to get cheaper OK the things are the one thing with mass production is that the things are going to get cheaper we're going to get cheaper medicine the healthcare the main advantage of AI is that OK the healthcare is bound to get cheaper and within the reach of common human being OK because right now we have doctors or doctor spend like thirteen years in school fifteen years plus ten years working on it it's like twenty five twenty six years they have to study OK to become good at that OK the AI can start'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but when'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they they most of hundred years from that particular doctor but it started his job OK so that it will be very cheap to go to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i analysis OK and the second thing is that there will not limitations OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK but let's let's say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'let's say you live somewhere that where your power grid is in a strong so like you're relying on the AI none of your people are going to middle school schooling more cause why cause the AI can do it but then you lose power or you lose you lose power then what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then you're without your AI'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK the thing is that with power and know that the there is like the power is going to be there OK it is going for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there is many countries in the world that still lose power really easily'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hi that is there but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a daily occurrence'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it doesn't like let me tell you another one example what a is doing in case of renewable energy OK there are ton of like i will there are ton of different nuclear reactors which are taking the use of AI for a nuclear fusion process the nuclear fusion is what powers the sun OK like if one nuclear reactor is there they can power the whole earth it's that they're experiment is successful without anything OK there will be no like there will be countries which don't have lines even OK so that kind of be there but the we don't have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah city of our anywhere OK if it is there OK but there are counterarguments everything if i said that OK there are there have been chernobyl accidents OK and then there were no AI powered robots also OK but it is very easy to control things OK AI is there OK there they can handle things much better than humans OK in case of risk in in case of risky jobs OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they can handle things much better than humans except for the whole area of emotions and empathy which is something that is you have to have to survive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is the human well OK this is the thing which has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even like a customer service the company i feel like that's already lost now and how you know you wanna be as a human you wanna be heard'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if there's an AI there that it's like stark and cold that's that's i for me that's a lot is lost i'm not saying it doesn't have its benefits i'm just saying that a lot is lost there and i don't think it should or needs to be used everywhere'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would agree with that totally'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is it well like like what what you can do is make humans lazy OK like right now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ninety percent of the company have employed chat'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's OK one of the thoughts that you they can't replace a person with a chat bot OK they're replacing the whole customer service department with the chat bot OK so this is there OK but it has a very high cost of creation OK so losing jobs is common with AI as AI advances there will be a ton of jobs which AI can replace OK but what you need to do is prepare them beforehand you have to have an excel which can't be replaced by an AI OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the government should increase that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that's our big concern is that there isn't these steps aren't being taken ahead of time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's AI is here now people are losing their jobs now they're not how are they gonna get trained in something else completely different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they've already lost let's say they've already lost their jobs so then now what they have no money they need schooling to to have the skills to perform a different job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the thing is that the thing is that you can't you can't ban AI OK like what government can do in case what what is the alternate solution like you can't you can't remove like you can regulate that but you can't just high technical technological advancement OK if you hide that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no way should be banned we're should be regulated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah nobody saying that though nobody saying we should hinder the advancement of technology we're saying that it should be used for good and that it should be regulated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because as it stands now a lot of things are not regulated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the thing is that in AI the yeah is a very small pocket of information which we have today OK like i can work in my home on artificial intelligence OK like i can train the eyes from my home so regulation part is very difficult for someone OK like if someone is doing a regulation it has it is very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they can't regulate over that which is in every once home OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that's that's difficult OK what you can do is that you can train people to adopt the AI and you can move with the use of that you can create a ton of new job on the basis of this you can have the university design here alternate courses OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for that there should be principles to use artificial then you can have some principles which everyone can use or something like that OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but what about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'another area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pretty out there like you said factory jobs so let's say you have a factory job so obviously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you might not have a higher level of education so then now what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK now the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and on the education side i even worry about children today there's no need for them to retain knowledge if all they have to do is turn and ask a computer what the answer is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean they don't even know how to speak to basically the sponsor'",
        "'speaker_3': 'doctors that is a very good point like one of the amazing points i worked today OK amazing point OK but nowadays there is one thing like we used to remember things very easily OK nowadays children are following things very now and then OK like my mother used to find everything which was gift in home at the fingertips OK i'm not able to do that OK that's my children's are much worse OK so it is there so there is this thing OK like they think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so then if that's true right so then you're saying also the more that AI takes over the stupider we are as this as a society because we're doing less so we're not just lazier we're doing less i think humans are capable a lot of things i don't think that machines need to take over everything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is this one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is that's bound to see'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK there is an oscar winning movie of payday pixel OK like i didn't remember his name where there was an a robot and the whole humanity was on E I O K and what they did they just became fat and got to the outside of the environment OK so it was bad which i predicted there and it is bound to happen like see no one uses their hands to wash towards anymore because they all have washing machines'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no one you generally people don't use to wash it until they are dishwasher that OK so this is bound to happen OK like things are bound to replace today OK previously there were like a ton of washers available everywhere OK their main job is to wash codes for people OK but right now everyone has washing machine OK so this is bound to happen'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but my washing machine my washing machine can't potentially injure or harm somebody'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is one aspect OK which the AI has not yet reached OK it is i think it is never going to reach that level OK like within our lifetimes OK so that it can do that OK but there's there will be some guidelines the USA as one of the pinnacles of technical advancement they have a great team there they will have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but would you say there's a lot of different ways of hurting people like let's say you're using a celebrity you're using AI to to you know to fake that they're there are some celebrity doesn't that hurt them it can hurt their career'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it pinch it can hurt their career and their livelihood'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you don't get it it is still OK this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK like the thing is that but you can't control that you can just you can have some other technology which can tell that whether this is fake or whether this is genuine OK you can develop that OK there is the counter for technologies and other technology OK it is not that you can't turn the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whole thing down OK you can have a different technology which can tell that whether it is genuine whether it is doctored OK that you can have always OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it is there OK but there is a very high cost to that OK so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is nothing like free range OK so yeah it runs at a very high spot parts OK they have to have a ton of machines they have to have a expertise OK so like people are sitting at their home is not going to make doctored videos OK if someone has invested a ton only then they can do that OK and they can trace it back also if you have good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'systems at their please OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're using it now though in ways that are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'plus'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is also one thing OK AI can like this is my personal opinion that it can never imitate a human OK like devices are sensible but they don't have feelings or ethics OK plus we have evaluation of hundred thousand years OK they are just right now being bought OK the humans have been evolving since last i think i don't know how many many years we are in this planet OK so they can't just come here and be our master OK we will be masters always so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so the thing about artificial intelligence is like it brings so many things even down to like our home devices like the amazon echoes the goodness they're all ran by things like that cause when you speak into your microphone and ask it a question you have to know that someone 's not sitting there answering you that fast'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh that don't say that that's where that is totally true OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK if you talk to your your if you talk to your home device and you're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but also because easily collect the information'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're like hey can you turn on my lights and you're in your bedroom but your kitchen lights cut on you don't have anyone to blame but yourself because you didn't teach yourself to be specific'",
        "'speaker_1': 'versus what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that there's so many different types of artificial intelligence to this point is it's where it's it's a choice it's not something that's forced on people in any device that we have there's options for you to go inside and switch it to your regular being or if you want assistance and i do i remember hearing something about on social media how it does get in the way of things yes there it is very annoying going into your settings and clocking down on it and actually catching it and stopping all the things that are going through party but it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's it's in the contract and everything that you said you have to read it very carefully you know down to when things ask you like hey would you like to show personalized'",
        "'speaker_1': 'advertisements for you well you gotta know that when you push yes there's it's not some stalker that's gonna stalk you around town shooting you advertisements that's gonna ask you to marry you one day it's it's a computer or some type of CPU that's going to clock your movements your your your health apps if you have it you're the things that you click on the things that you show interest in the things that you go on the internet and look at to purchase but you don't make a purchase the things that you do go make a purchase for it's gonna line all those things up on like a timeline'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and it's gonna try to get you to either save your money spend your money and be healthier or like she was saying sometimes it's not always good if you have people that are in control of these situations that don't have good intentions you're gonna get spam'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_4': 'book'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or what about when they're collecting all that information that they've gathered through all of that API so there was somebody there that's not stalking you but they know everything about you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK this is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that is that OK that is that OK and right now there was like a very big incident in the US whether elections were manipulated using this data particularly OK there are very big scandal OK with a particular'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes that person isn't reviewable and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is a fact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's actually a fellow way that you do your research you can he didn't get into the nitty gritty and find out who those people are because most things in life are public knowledge as long as you reach out to actually grab that knowledge it's not a secret you can go to your local courthouses in and find out who those people are if you if you really really really need to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but they are manipulating elections using that OK they are manipulating people 's mindset towards a particular judgment they have managed brickset using that OK like they have just have the data of the people they targeted that are people with ads and they have changed the opinion of the people from one thing to another thing OK that is one of the parts where regulations can be there OK no not a single person or company can have that much at on people OK like let me tell you one great thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you you dope has GDPR what GDPR does is that they can't keep your data after a time OK they have to delete your data OK like not a single company can do that to your point citizen but US does not have that because it is a capitalistic economy OK but this is a very big thing that your data is your data OK it is none of their data OK so they can't keep it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they can't have that appearance on you to target you OK that there has to be some guidance some registration some regulations to counter that OK because the AI is a like the AI is not bad OK the masters of AI is going to be bad OK if AI like if you have that intention you can create bad products if you have good intention you can create good products OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it's the technology though that's moving faster than the regulating'",
        "'speaker_3': 'called the technology going very way too fast'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes and that does cause problems which which has to do with people it really sucks because people are such an a race to get forward so quickly sometimes but they never really realized that while they're racing to get that forward to get ahead of everyone they're still gonna have to come to a point where they have to stop and and be in renewal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm and then we all learn what went wrong what happened and why and and who's to blame for those things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but it's like pandora's box once they're out you can't stuff them back in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes ma'am it's just like when you wish upon a star or you you put something on your christmas list it's the same thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hides'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it does it target thought there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or the grass is being on the other side you always think you want something and once you have it you realize how bad it could be or what the you know what the plans are nothing is perfect'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'also worry about the the impact of this on small businesses because these large corporations can put in all these development dollars and everything else and take away from people the businesses that can't afford to keep up with it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is there but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my nap'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the small businesses are thriving on because of the lesions OK or because of the human values you can go there even chat with the person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i am in complete support of this because i don't watch the utilize artificial intelligence and their things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because they are more focused on being personable and old fashioned and they know that that those are people that are really into taking accountability so they're like listen this is my company i don't use artificial intelligence i might be a little bit slower because i'll be doing this off myself unless i hire other other people but i want you to know that in situations like that is something does go wrong you come to me and i know it's my fault i'm not gonna be dating that it's my fault i'm gonna do what i can to fix the problem and go forward'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'versus having artificial intelligence businesses always have something to blame things on on even though they could be the person programming it to do that they still have that extra like insurance of liability that they can try to strike against themselves'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean like think about like even like when you're when you're contacting anybody amazon AT and T whoever once you go online you chat it's it's a bot right but how they they just go through a standard things they can't address all issues and more often than not like i have to get transferred to human'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that can see what my situation is you know what i mean and address it that way if it's not your run of the mill you need to return something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'most of the time everyone wants to speak to a customer a human being OK like human being can understand the problem better OK this is always there the human beings are the the human beings are thriving on because you can talk to each other OK there's a human connect if you tell your problem to amazon executive he will be able to understand it not an AI OK even though how would the AI is OK your voice represents your problems OK if you are furious you can see the person can sense that he this person is furious he have been defrauded by something hey'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's crazy all the things that can still be going on your device with you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the human because that's why the small businesses thriving why because they have the human connect you can go to their so you can chat with them you can get the product recommendations OK sometimes you go to a store and say well sir try this new thing OK we have just this new food came into the market and try that thing you like it you tell them you don't like it to tell them OK but they are trying on the basis of relations which i can't build that right now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're thriving if you go to any town there is a lot more chains than there are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know smaller businesses i don't think they're thriving i think more and more closing especially after the pandemic so like like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like doreen was saying it's hard to compete with that right so as a small business if if AI is the way that things are going eventually they feel like what they're doing is outdated and they might have to just close because they can't compete financially'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i worry we're we're all sitting here we know what customer service is and the need for a person i'm not real sure that my down the road my grandkids and my great grandkids who never really had that experience with good customer service they're not going to feel a need for it they'll be fine interacting with the computer but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as a society i think that's wrong'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's where you just really have to teach them like what kind of things to ask of it before you know so they don't end up in the same complaint categories as we are now and just to only sign on to things that they know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on is trustworthy or credible'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you don't wanna we don't want them signing on the things that are just gonna ruin their devices and their lifestyle'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it's hard though because they're so used to it and so i think they feel like if it's out there that means they can trust it which is obviously not true but think about like like even my kids now they're like they're view of things are so different like with you see the kids interacted with each other they don't feel the need to even hang out anywhere like go somewhere and meet each other and i find that strange like you don't wanna see your friends'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're fine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i just like that they're talking to them over the over the headset always OK they're like talking to them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no because they're they're presented with the fact that the world is so dangerous they're safer there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but also there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK they're talking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if they're doing that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're also socializing all the time right through snapchat through tic tacs they're taxing you know so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how did their social circles have been deferred and they have changed what social workers we have we had OK like we want to hang out with friends we want to go out with them somewhere we want to travel with them OK they're like they're just want to see each other pictures always they want to see who is doing what that's why this influencer are going on and on and on they have to see what the next quite cool thing is they want to move on to the next cool thing their attention span has becoming too low OK they can't stick to one thing i want to use OK because of this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't have the technology OK but it can be utilized in a better manner like right now what you reuse to study OK the education is much more better now they are studying verbally visually OK and we used to study with the board in front of us OK and they are authorized being studying with a screen in front of them OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'things are different but just addiction should not be there OK if addiction can we control everything can we control'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we can only'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we can only have control over our own decisions and what we put into this life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and what we accept out of this life'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i mean but but but so like some of it though is like we can but like children that have access to like social media and stuff like i limit my children's access right but that doesn't mean they can't find another way'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i mean we we can choose but they don't have that choice as much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know what i mean because it's getting crammed down their throats everywhere they're go they're they're becoming more and more reliant on technology you know they have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it becomes an addiction'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes and you just have to hope that that's what they had in mind when they did the coronavirus break when the kids weren't allowed to go to school anymore we just have to really hope that that was part of the situation they were looking at things at when they stopped it so when they did continue to go back to school they have more of an idea what to be looking for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean hopefully'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean i i kind of seen it in action so i do know that you can have a faith it was at least that much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but i'll study will gain countless hours of productivity OK if there are some autonomous'",
        "'speaker_1': 'look at some other things i learned in school from the actual from the the artificial intelligence that we had in school i remember we have this we have this big machine the first year it was a big gigantic machine and i remember what it's called but i don't wanna say it on here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it was teaching us things that was it might have been it wasn't things that harmed anyone but it was just funny things like that might not have been correct or they might have been correct and we don't know who programmed it or if they were even responsible for it being wrong but then the next year like they were the the next year they it came in a different form and it was funny because the bigger the bigger machine was faster but produced'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just just all kinds of responses which we didn't need all those responses because some of those responses guys have trouble versus the next version that we received was a little bit slower but gave us more accurate and and helpful and healthy responses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think i think i mean i think like like you're saying like there's it's there's a place for technology obviously it helps improve a lot of different things however like you said it's a race right so whenever you're in a hurry to do something typically there are flaws because you're in a hurry you'd rather them test it out completely and work out all the flaws and make sure wouldn't you rather gotten that second slower machine to at least i mean the first one was funny but at least you knew that the information was gonna be more accurate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so there is like one very good thing which the AI will counteract is the traffic issues OK with autonomous transportation OK you have to never face traffic again if the AI has its free and if the google and what elon musk is trying to do the autonomous transportation does that or it the driverless car'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we run out of time for this debate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i still am trying to get this to where i can load the conversation but i and i know that they want so many interruptions i don't know that we can actually accept that many over overlaps and interruptions because it seems that that is actually part of contributing to this i'm not gonna blame it on any one person at this time because i know that was asked for because of the task but i'm just seeing different things and i'm not a professional in anything but i did check some computer classes and i did ernest sort of occasion so i do know that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's some interference issues and even though we were asked to do this is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's not what the actual working of the software'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i was going to say if it's OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which is it's great so we're talking about artificial intelligence and i'm over here dealing with it myself'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was going to say i have to leave for another call if that's OK too i think you got your thirty minutes thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes ma'am don't have any red what all yes i'll just let them know what happened on this call and hopefully all of us will be can compensate for this call'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thanks so much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK that would be great that would be great that would be great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'alright thank'",
