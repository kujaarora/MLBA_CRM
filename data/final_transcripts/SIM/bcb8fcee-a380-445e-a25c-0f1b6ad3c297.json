        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a ritesh do you do you have a a point against that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yes yes i i will counter this by stating that as the coincide if there are minimum wages of if there are higher minimum wages they are going to affect my overall profit in cost of labor cost the employment cost will increase tremendously and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no the the human resource cost will soar the profit will be less so as a as a capitalist or as an entity which is into production i will have to either compromise on the quality or i will start investing more into machines more into technology because technology cost less i would be able to get in robots to do all my work i will get the artificial intelligence replacing the coders'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will get all the new technology because if that is going to happen then ultimately ultimately due to this higher cost higher minimum wages will affect the workforce only because they they are going to get replaced that is what i have to sync counter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK allison anything against that on the pro side'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well on the part of technology i feel like it might be cheaper to to begin with technology but as you continue the maintenance gets a lot you know costly so it might not be an effective route to take maybe just not very permanent route to take and i think that increasing minimum wage for employees can boost employee morale and can boost their you know motivation and it can work as in as an incentive to increase'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the employee retention and reduce hiring and training costs which means that your employees are gonna be more motivated to work for you and then you will have a higher you know outcome of you know output in your company or whatnot so yeah that's my take'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well with me being on the con side here i'll add to that that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'similar to what ritesh was saying that i think that if minimum wage were increased also ultimately the cost of living would rise as well and if the government put a price cap on products and services'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think only the companies who are bigger would survive because they can produce more by being more efficient by being more cost efficient so i think that would hurt the small businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the possibly do you have anything to say against that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh in case of minimum which is as you mentioned the cost of living cost of living is just not based on the minimum which is it is based on various societal norms which includes the cost of your basic needs which is your food clothing and shelter now having said that if employee or a labor cannot afford those things his will not be in a position to work properly his productivity will be done because his health will not be up to the mark'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh support the kind of environment that is required for an efficient working candidate now having said that it is also essential that the employee or the person or the labor who is going to help you produce more goods or manufacture more or deliver services they are in the healthy state of mind and body and that can be achieved only if they're basic needs are taken care of and minimum wage is as such if i understand properly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is governed by the various factors to ensure the basic needs are taken care of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so you don't think that if minimum wage were increased that the the basic cost of living would rise with that as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see again uh basic cost of living as i mentioned earlier is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'based on other parameters which is what is the cost of having to eat'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when children if the person has parents they have to take care of their aged parents in terms of their medical bills in terms of their other aspects while minimum which is just one part of it along with that you also have other benefits which are related to this which are related to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in india we call it PF that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your medical related EIC etcetera so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'minimum wages is part of the package which consolidates one where again if you have to purchase something you have to have some earnings to support those purchases so yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh as you grow as in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'industry as you grow as a country as you grow as an economic culture as the industries come into picture the economic standard of the employees should also increase you do not want to have any person living below the poverty line or living below the minimum expectation of earnings if they are working so minimum which is ensures that these are taken care so that the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'company benefits the employee benefits'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh now this might be taken as a non capitalist'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh purview but as it has to be a win win situation for both the organization and the employee minimum which just has to be there so that both of them know for a fact that this is the minimum expenses as an organization they have to give away'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that there is no exploitation sorry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep and two'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and to add to what uh tapaswi is you know talking about i feel like an increase or just a refusal of increase for you know the minimum wage can be sort of detrimental to the society considering that if you're not paying people enough to sustain their lives then it internally leads to you know a decline in population and you have less and less people coming about you know every other day so it's also detrimental to the human population at the end of the day'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so the increase of minimum wage does you know in fact like impact everybody in the long run'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm thank you allison yeah rajesh please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there there is a definitely counter about it because there is something called as minimum wages which are paid statutory in cache one is the cache component and second the component like the person was telling is the kind component like for example the provident fund provident fund is part of your salary which is deducted and contributed equally by the employer which is saved for your old age i mean when you are not working this there's probably in fund helps you at that time second like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is the medical health benefits that is in india it is employee service that there are hospitals which are run through EIC organization that is true there are also many programs many laws which are there right payment of wages act is there industrial disputes act is they're not many laws are there OK i agree but there is a con to it if i start paying my workforce excessively i'm using the word excessively because minimum wages'",
        "'speaker_2': 'scanned it's a very subjective thing it can be bare enough it can be moderate and it could be excessive it's it's a it's a very subjective thing so if if i pay my workforce excessively there are cons to it one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the workforce will not become competitive because they know even if they are not working they are not putting it enough they are going to be paid and they're going to be paid nice'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two they won't go for extra mile they won't walk extra mile to upgrade themselves because you know the comfort factor it's a human nature the comfort factor creeps in very quickly we adjust as per over situation if my situation worsens i adapt to it if my situation improves i adapt to it quickly so if my minimum wages are made arbitrarily high'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by law then what will happen i will i will have a unfair advantage now third point is also there third point is there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will become lethargic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like for example there is a very very great example which the person will understand being from india there was a seventh pay commission seventh pay commission happened in two thousand sixteen two thousand sixteen yes two thousand six fifth pay commission came then two thousand sixteen seventh pay commission came so what seventh pay commission did it increased the salaries of government employees exponentially i mean a fourth level pyon pyon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'gets forty five thousand rupees whereas whereas outside in private companies appen gets fifteen thousand rupees or twenty thousand rupees so when we have fixed the salary by law they stopped working the fear is not there the motivation and morale is not there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i have seen i have seen in places in states a poorer states of india where government is giving free russian free food to people they don't work they said why we have to work we have enough government gives us enough but when there is a when there is a bar to free like they say there is nothing called free learn then we give them like their own let them earn but the minimum wages should not be prohibitively high they should be moderate so that of a workforce'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'gets good compensation they can you know live nicely they should be able to sustain themselves with the all the basic necessities and if they are good and if they're proving themselves good they should get on the next level but if we talk about minimum wages to be made prohibitively high it is going to affect society in a negative manner yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yeah thank you rajesh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh allison do do you have a response to that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for me i just have to say that increasing the minimum wage might not you know affect the society in a negative way to put it because at the end of the day increasing minimum wage can you know include the consumer spending it can increase consumer spending it will reduce government assistance and it will just you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh you know boost that the employee retention so i just think that consumer spending and all of that would help in the you know society so increasing the minimum wage of you know employees is a good thing because it also helps you know low income families and just helps people you know get out of the you know the bar of poverty as we know it now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah thank you allison tapaswi anything to add'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah there are two points which generally minimum which is considered there are multiple levels of minimum wages when you say multiple villages levels there is skilled unskilled and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh finish up kind of a scenario and it varies from industry to industry so coming back to what ritesh had said yes it is taking care in it is considering the fact that the skill level of the employee is taken into consideration while remunerating them with the minimum wages another thing aspect of it is when you say ration is given free or a food parcels are given to people who do not earn'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it makes them complacent now when'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is that is bound to happen for a reason because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they do not have work to do and we can from a government perspective you cannot have your population undergoing starvation so that is more of a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'social reforms that are required by the government over a period of time that will also go away'",
        "'speaker_4': 'coming back to the other aspect from an economic development point of view as alison sid when the minimum wages is implemented the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'economic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh stability of a country or a state increases substantially rather than saying substantially according to the kind of environment that is because even the government wants to have industries coming to their state for their state income to work their machineries'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh in terms of the seventh pay commission etcetera they are more related to government jobs and not to the entire scenario well as minimum wages considers the entire scenario which is not just government employees but also employees who are associated with companies which are non government in nature or which are more of private limited more of public limited companies who need to hire more people or who need to function with the employees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm uh yeah allison please yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm just to just to add something on that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm you know it's been demonstrated and you know economic patterns as well can suggest that low wage earners are more likely to you know put their income directly back into the economy and you know that's because low wage workers are most likely to spend a larger portion of their budget on you know immediate needs and stuff to like food clothing transportation shelves other likes so increasing you know the consumer spending is a good thing and it's a positive you know factor to the economy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as it will reflect you know consumer confidence in the market and it will bring about more revenue to small businesses and businesses and corporations yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah this is one more thing there is one more part to it it could be unfair among the workforce itself'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alright yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like in workforce there are two type of people one who works very hard who earns his bread through hard work dedication being honest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and there are another type of people among the workforce every every society has them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who do not work that hard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who is not skilled that skilled who doesn't put in more effort who doesn't upgrade himself'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who doesn't willingly go for training no if we put both of the workforce and start judging them with the same parameter and giving them the same minimum wages which is applicable so this is definitely disadvantageous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do the workforce to the workman who is working hard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who is aspiring'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but this is disadvantageous to them and one who is not equivalent to him who is not at par with him is also getting the same salary it is like in my class like i'm i'm in a school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in my school the losses that everybody will pass to the next class'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right so anyone who is working very hard with studying very hard burning the midnight oil uh referring extra books taking extra courses will also pass and the one who doesn't work who is lethargic who doesn't give a damn to what teacher is teaching in class he's also past so to whom it is a disadvantageous so this this minimum wages mandatory minimum wages is disadvantageous to the person who is definitely working very hard'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so so are you are you focusing more on the UM part where it's fair or unfair to the ones working hard or are you focusing more on the part that you think it's better for general performance general output'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see i am focusing one on the general output also because this minimum wages is for the general part so but if somebody is below part'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they are forced to as an employer i'm forced to give him also the same amount of salary even he's not deserving it i'm i'm forced to give at the end of the week or at the end of the month i have to give him pay package as per the law'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that is disadvantageous though he is not up to that mark so what i will do i will start reduction i will start reducing them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will start now i i i recently in the month of december i handled a case no i'm sorry in the month of january i handled a case where a big company i will not name the company this company is in gurugram gurgaon that company is being shut down they are removing three thousand five hundred employees what was the reason the reason is the workforce with the passage of time has become a big part of the budget'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the HR budget is huge i mean the thirty percent of the HR is going in in in the salaries so what they decided they're shutting down the company they're opening some sham companies and they will hire people on a contractors role i mean they are outsourcing their budget now the contractor will pay minimum wages minimum wages and the company will become profitable so what will happen if we implement this minimum wage as rule those people who are not so efficient and and they don't want to become efficient even by working the general'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK criteria they will uh the employer will be forced to pay them when employer will be forced to pay them they will always start finding other mails so ultimately society will be at disadvantage yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right OK thank you yeah tapaswi please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh the example here i would like to code that in a team everybody can't be messy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so there will be a people who are overachieving and there will be people who are under achieving the minimum wages is not for evaluating these people the minimum which is basically a tool to ensure that whoever comes to an organization he is evaluated bases the skill set as mentioned in the minimum wages and is remunerated equivalently based on the evaluation done there now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'answering to ritesh in terms of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the profitability the competency of the employees it is part and parcel of every business organization and the industry parameters there are also rules and regulations which governs that such complacent employees can be removed with the help of the rules and regulations available minimum wages does not look into those criteria as such it only looks at the simple equation if a person is equipped to work in a particular role'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is the minimum he or she should get'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right OK allison anything to after that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes i agree with tapasvi and saying that you know the minimum wages does not deal with a certain criteria of you know how employees work in the you know in the business or in the company so it should not be a a detrimental factor to the other employees who are able to you know you know build an output proper output of what they're doing and they're work it should not affect them in how the the minimum wage should affect them so i think saying that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but minimum wage should not be increased because of some workers not being able to create a a good output is kind of putting other workers in a box and it's not allowing for people to be able to you know say that this isn't right so i think minimum wage should be increased in the in the sense that workers are putting enough effort and are not getting you know a good output as to whatever they're putting in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i think that minimum minimum wage should be increased and the increase of the minimum wage you know in turn will affect how motivated employees are in to some extent it can also encourage employees who are not able to put you know enough effort into what they're doing it can also encourage them to put some effort into you know work better as you know an outcome of the increase in minimum wage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm alright thank you so uh i said earlier that i thought that if minimum wage were to increase that the cost of living would also increase and by that the power line would also increase and the password you were countering that but asking rajesh now do you think the poverty line or the base cost of living would stay where it's at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if minimum wage were to increase'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ritesh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah can you hear me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yes did you hear my question'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know you you were asking tapas with that right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no i was i was asking you because debashree were was countering that point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the uh but i'm well i'm asking your opinion or well your expertise if you think that the poverty line or the base cost of living would stay where it is even if minimum wage were to be increased'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so there would be certain effect then it would because this is this is not in isolation there are many many factors involved in it poverty line if we talk about the people who are on the below poverty line or on the edge of poverty line they are always supported by respective government in every country and every society or every developing society the food is given to them on subsidized rates the even even in india the government'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the modi government is uh building houses for them you know on a very subsidized rates so that is true but if we if we enhance the standard of society as a whole just by increasing minimum wage that is a question true but ultimately ultimately this comes back to us because if i'm increasing cost of manufacture yeah cost in input cost if i'm for example i'm working i'm hiring laborers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'laborers workman to work in my farm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i am a farmer i produce wheat and i need hundred men hundred people to work in my farm and if there is an increased minimum salary which i have to pay to them so i will not lessen my margins what i will do i will increase the cost of wheat if i was selling it before at thirty five rupees per K G i'm going to increase it to forty rupees per KG or fifty rupees per K G so i will i will not reduce my margin i will never be at loss'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what will happen this week ultimately who is going to buy it is going to be bought by the society the people in society to somebody is going to pay for it so if one hand is give us other hand is taken so if i am giving the minimum wages to the society my other hand is taking the money back from them in in in in form of increased prices'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for ultimately the balance remains same that is not how this is going to work yes there will be disadvantaged it also because if a manufacturer is a if a farmer if a producer yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah ritesh ritesh uh so pardon me for interrupting you but since we're nearing the end to tapasvi and allison does that sound logical to you or do you have anything to counter to that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh what british is discussing is more to do with the economic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh so criteria are or the economic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'juncture of a political political'",
        "'speaker_4': 'country or other if you look at it the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'input and output of income'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
