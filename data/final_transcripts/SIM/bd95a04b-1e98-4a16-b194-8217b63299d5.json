        "'speaker_2': 'uh it's either test on animals or humans and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know what do you do if you i mean how are you gonna test something if you don't test on something so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'total'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is justified in some ways sometimes i think they do things that they shouldn't even be testing about but i guess that's life and that's you know'",

        "'speaker_2': 'have we find things out'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i get where you're going shelly i don't agree with like testing makeup and stuff on animals i think it depends on what you're testing i think if you're testing let's say we just went through the coronavirus and you're testing to try to find a vaccine or something to help save'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah carnivores'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think it depends on how you'",

        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know how bright they are is it something that is this an animal i'm gonna use the old thing that we can put up into space before we send the human up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then they would understand what to do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm so there's there's lots of different testing to do too where some of it i feel is like yeah let's do that but at the same time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'testing to see if they makeup is gonna break somebody out or do something like that that to me is artificial'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right definitely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and doesn't'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to test arnold but if you're doing something like makeup or don't know toothpaste or something like that then it doesn't doesn't really make any sense for these animals to suffer and you know the like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah something that that improves lives or saves lives then most definitely but something you know like you said testing makeup or or something like that no that mean that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the potential'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know if if you want to wear makeup then you know maybe you should put it on yourself and test it i mean you know so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right but it'",

        "'speaker_2': 'that if you wouldn't do it to you know if you wouldn't do it to yourself then why do it'",

        "'speaker_2': 'my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sick lambs and i know that's so bad to just mention that cause but i i'm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'weird about that and rats people just seem not like having everywhere which is great because we don't want holes and everything i guess but say we say where there was like a lamp there was like a group of lambs that had in one had like a'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think also depending what what animals were testing because like you said people don't really care about rats but most people would feel more compassion to like monkeys or dogs or cats or so like where do we draw the line what animals can you test ones can you test can you not test on and how well do you have to treat these ones i think it also depends on what what animals did you test it on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i know they have to test on animals that you know are have the closest i guess i don't know what genes or or resemblance to a human you know because i don't pigs they have pretty much from what i understand basically the same you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you and i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i don't know you know what i'm trying to say the same i don't know it's not yeah thank you yes yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'dna yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'genetic makeups and like cells and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can like caps yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their jeans'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes thirty so the you know cause so that it would work on you know a human'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so but i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but not only do they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but not only do we do testing on i mean animals as like animal animals but what about all of the testing that's done and you know like we mentioned cancer on cancer patients to see if a medicine is going to work or not you know some of them get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but there's there's one difference we can say yes or no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we can content and they can't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'animals can't you know they they can't tell you oh no i don't wanna do that but you know even though they offer people you know a compensation for you know being a test dummy i guess you you know but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'll for example i see a reason that animal testing could be justified and and i i just found a reason for it and i don't know where i just pulled this from but i know that i have been a person individually that would not mind doing a sleep study i know they do sleep studies and they pay people for it where they hook you up to like different things and they monitor your dreams and it can help them with how you actually behave why you're not in your rim cycles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now if we have problematic animals i would i was thinking like well that's a test that probably i would like i would i would allow it for myself but if i were to see someone testing on an animal i would have questions sleep testing on an animal i would have ample questions but then as i thought about it i came to a situation where i found it useful because if we have aggressive animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a sleep study would be OK because if we do then match it to aggressive human behavior and if those i don't know that we we probably can't legally own wow this is great while we probably can't legally'",
        "'speaker_1': 'force uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'aggressive person into a sleep study'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but if we were to focus on those animals during their sleep and the things that happened to their brain during their sleep we might get why they're so aggressive versus the rest of the pack while they're awake but the finding the constant and that is different because of the variables we have to work with we can't really put aggressive people forcefully into sleep studies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but the animals we probably are allowed to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just to like save our families it's like say there's a rabid raccoon somewhere we're not even rabid say there's no foam at his mouth and there's nothing but this thing just keeps coming and scratching up your stuff and knocking at your window and it's like man i wish i could hook that thing up to this tester to see what happens in its sleep like what is telling it to come mess with me when it wakes me up when it wakes up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well you know that they have like people that were in jail they did do tests on them without even their consent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right a long time ago especially'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know just because they're in jail you know they said oh well you're in jail so i'm just gonna test on you i mean but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes they did just stop them from doing that there was like i think it was in like in this in more than one of the more southern states i believe they had had a well when you're in solitary confinement they do keep the lights on twenty four seven but they're at a certain time they dim them in this in this area so you're always you always have the lights on there's no point in these jails that you have any dark there's always a light on right there with you but in other states they weren't even dimming the lights at bedtime they were just having these'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bright fluorescent lights on the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the inmates twenty four seven and that is definitely people testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well also too i guess i would just look something up and it says the research benefits to human health outweigh the costs or harm to animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's why there is why animal testing is justified so the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so keep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would hope they would i would hope if given the chance being animals didn't say the same thing about humans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry can you repeat that i didn't i didn't hear that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah ohh i'm gonna try and see if you taste good how's that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm gonna eat you and see i'm gonna check'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK hold on abdul didn't hear me it says that medical research because of the benefits to human health outweigh the cost or harm to animals'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i can i can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it is cheaper for us it is a lot cheaper for us to do research on animals than it is on humans to be to come up with and it's the medical field gets more and more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'advanced and has stronger you know finding cures for cancer cures for dementia and stuff like that that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like basically they just said we don't want to pay any money or company or do any compensation or we can do it for free'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i mean like i said i'm not against it and i'm not for it i'm just you know i'm in the middle things after some things have just have to be done in order to help human lives i mean that unfortunately that's how it is and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know you just gotta go with the flow roll with the punches'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if we if we use a rat or something and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they find the cure for cancer the thousands of people that that's going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know save'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i think we're getting we're getting closer and closer everyday to something like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think they already have the cure and they're just you know keeping it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they would have to because if they found the cure for cancer in a rat do you know how low profile we would have to keep that to to stop mass like destruction'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i know i know i think i really do i think that they do have a cured everything that is out there but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you got your health care even though that's not really the subject but you know i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with health care is one of the main things that we use animal testing on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it's also cute do and do animals such as rats and that is what they use a lot do they feel pain less than other animals is that why they use them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah see that's that's a good question and how would you know that it does you know that that they feel less pain how do i mean unless you you know speak right or something you know they don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would love to be able to say no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i was going to say i i would love to be able to say no they don't feel the pain but if you've ever heard a mouse or a rat'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that cream'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in yeah it is awful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes it is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like i'm a human and like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it would send chills through my body like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they're just so small and the biggest part of them is their their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their torso area where i know if it's a female that's where she makes her babies and i just get so like ohh i have a friend that she's a rat mom by the way she has like multiple rats as pets so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i had to start looking at things from a different angle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i mean i think it's i think animal testing is justifiable depending on what is being tested'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and like abdul said how are the emails getting treated and why yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and why'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also how effective as this testing is it is it actually gonna'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and why'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is yes we're not just testing fine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are we actually gonna care'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is where i am i do not think it's right to test for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like like we said i mean i just think of makeup because superficial yes thank you thank you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like superficial stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i've done things as a child to animals that i don't believe i would do as an adult but there are also things that if i were to catch a child doing to their animal i might say something but i wouldn't penalize them like when i was a child i put my sunglasses on my dog i thought it was funny'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK well there's i mean that's cute'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well now that i'm gonna do what i'm thank you now that i'm i'm i'm older and i'm a mom i'm like ohh my goodness that poor dog was seeing bright and then i just put'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'dark on his eyes he probably had no idea what was going on what did i do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah we'll see but that's innocent that's not you know i mean that's how i look at it it it's not something that's that's harming the animal i mean i don't believe but you know i don't know the dog could be saying i'm gonna you know bite you if you don't get these off or you know it's just'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i don't know that i agree with it now that i don't know if i agree with it then but i i i don't know if i agree with what i saw at all i don't even understand what the point of the well the test was is what do these things eat'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_3': 'OK so i can remember i can remember in in science we did a mama pig with three babies in her but mama had died naturally'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it haunts me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh OK OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so the babies were there so it was like seeing like what the reproductive organs and how it all look'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no digest them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you for participating in that in that dissection thank you for that because that i looked at that a totally different way just now like if if the if the pig and it's young were not killed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for that type of thing i agree because maybe we could help'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no they were not too well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right so i have how do we find the answer so that this mama this any animal doesn't have to go through that again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes correct accurate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right but unfortunately ones that have already passed on that you really can't get any results as far as testing because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah from there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they need you know they have to be alive in order for the you know the test to go but yeah what you're saying there like for and and for schools and stuff if something died naturally then yeah there's i don't see anything wrong with that but if you intentionally kill it for you know that no i don't agree with that at all but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for the frogs to be praised they'll be dissected'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what about so well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what about potential solutions for annual testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh what was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what was that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what did you say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what about what about potential solutions for our testing what about so let's say let's imagine that we improved quality technology so the point that we could clone a human without the brain so the so they wouldn't be conscious'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we've already planned here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we would stop animal testing would cease no everyone would be scared to animal test ever again'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so would that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so would we test on these bodies or would we keep our testing do you think that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they probably would they would probably threat to test on those bodies and people would instantly stop testing animals because they would probably do the math in their head like hey if we're testing on animals and they're making these'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'clones with no brains what are they gonna do next they're gonna ask me what's wrong with me and i'm not answering they're gonna instantly not want anything tested on animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well my question is if we if we make a client with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i mean yeah cause you could just make another person i mean so yeah why would you test on the animals after that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but if we make a clone without'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a brain and we're testing for like stroke victims and stuff that's not something that we can do if it if the animal or person or the animal doesn't have a brain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but the thing there is if that if we were to do something like that so let me just use me as an example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the one time like that i'm living to mars'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like if if i'm gonna use me so i don't put anybody else in a bad situation hopefully not putting myself in a bad situation either but if i knew that say i had some type of disease or syndrome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they needed help figuring things out about it they cloned me and made a version of me without a brain i would then think about everything i've ever done what might have made me sick and i would go they're gonna find that when they open up that version of me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a brain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what is about to happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah OK i can see that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i believe that's why it's not done masterly now because people would really have to halt in their footsteps and be like they're about to know the truth'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and my for for me if that were to happen i'd be OK because i'm like yep i did that that's in there i do that on a regular whoops that's what happened i'll stop now some people are gonna be like well now i have to kill the doctor because they know what i've been doing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'look at look at our look at our country and just and i'm gonna go back to the bird flu we've had such a bad breakout of bird of the bird flu is it OK to test the the chickens and stuff to make sure that they don't have it and to figure out why they have it if they do have it'",

        "'speaker_1': 'still to this day i'm almost thirty years old and i tell myself i'm not all the time sometimes i get real and tell myself what happened but on a regular i still go with the fact because it would hurt me inside i go with the fact of no my family said the the woods monster got it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like we'd go outside and there's like feathers everywhere i believe we probably ate it but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so somebody says somehow our chickens and our turkeys and stuff got the avian bird flu it killed millions of them that's why our egg prices have gone up so much and other things and like chicken and stuff and why they also said that turkeys were hard to find over the over the holidays but it did it was in the country it did kill millions of them and it's like to me it's OK to test the other birds to make sure they don't have it and also too if they do find one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to figure out how to control it so that we don't have a situation like this again where millions of our chickens and turkeys and ducks and everything are getting killed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah there's nothing wrong with testing it testing because i mean we do it on humans we test to see if you you know like the covid you get tested to see if you have it and stuff so there's nothing wrong with like the like that you know testing at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because if the if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you could you could also justify that at the end you at the end of animal testing you always need a human test subject to come to like start verifying the medicine actually works so you could argue that you could just skip the angle to this and go straight to human testing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that that that's but that's'",

        "'speaker_3': 'why'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you mean like the autopsies and stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well like my daughter is a nurse and the school she picked was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'had the only cadaver lab for freshman nursing and so she was able to go into bodies and stuff right away but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's a little bit different too is eighties bodies were donated to science B they're very respectful of these bodies by keeping the faces covered and stuff so you've never look at the person 's face unless you're doing something on it but it'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my yeah because i mean this is also the cadaver lab the people have you know like you said they they've you know consented to you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be you know to be looked at and and look and see what what is in the body and stuff like that or what you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean if an animal looked at me'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm one to but and i could be completely vulnerable and gullible with this this is where i will mention the monkeys i guess'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but with those those silverbacks if that were to happen i would want like if say it it did something and it got a broken arm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i'm pretty sure it's seen people this whole time with casts coming to the to the zoo because if my child had a broken arm i might be like you know let's go to the zoo you had a rough day when i maybe the next day or something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but he's probably the those animals and she they probably seen people in casts and slings and things as such so i would hope that if it ever broke its arm and i hold a sling up to it it might'",
        "'speaker_1': 'register in his head like that's for my arm i hope so'",

        "'speaker_3': 'you are very intelligent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's they're they're very intelligent creatures'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from i mean from what some of the stuff that i have seen'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now i've got a friend who is over the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm the monkeys and all the primates and stuff at our zoo and what they like we were talking to her one day and she was holding my granddaughter and one of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh god what are they the howler monkeys the female got really mad and jealous'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because she saw her holding my granddaughter and wasn't paying attention to her'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh no i don't like you have a mom like what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're they're supposed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah the the hell are monkeys they're very aggressive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i heard they throw their feces at you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah well yeah all all of them all primates or like that yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sometimes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or at things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's even people that do that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yes there is i didn't believe that until'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there is there is a there is no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'go to go to LA and go through the homeless district'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh no work at a jail and all there is is bars oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they they throw a lot of stuff at you so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have heard that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'been there done that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think i think we have i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so everyone almost has reached their six minutes abdul do you have anything else that you'd like to put in on the subject'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think it's mostly a compassion thing to be honest i i really questioned how effective these tests are especially since medicines so old i'm like because at the end of the day you do need test on the human before'",
        "'speaker_4': 'machines can be uh if we can completely accept the results so within a better alternative to be to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they'll focus more on that which is from development and then this may sound cruel but didn't test on their human that has turning it L to someone that needs that's on desk door that needs the medicine to work so they've gone to lose and then that'll be a better alternative than testing on our loads of animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and causing needless suffering'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know if i would i mean especially if it's just if they just developed it and then just like the covid the covid vaccine i i won't get it because there has not been ample time to test and and see what this is actually going to do in the long run to people i mean i know now it does it does you know keep you from getting in or whatever but how do you know in twenty years five years ten years that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but not stuff like cover that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's it's not gonna you know do something to you but that we don't know about because we did not have ample time to test it which i mean i i know we didn't you know they had to do something but i mean there there needs to be ample time of testing and and so i guess you know depending looks like we were saying depending on what and what we were testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'first testing on animals you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'stuff that we actually need yeah but like we were saying the superficial stuff you know i don't they we shouldn't do that i mean if you wanted that back then volunteer go to a clinical trial you know but something that we actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'donita'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but both the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yet if if the if the person is terminally L they don't they don't really have much to lose so best case'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they they'll pay you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i mean yeah that that would be a yeah a clinical trial but and they would be agreeing to it so i mean yeah if i was in that position to where i was dying anyway and i knew it could help you know potentially save lives then y'all would do it i mean i'm dying anyway and if it helps somebody then you know and helps them move forward and and in their in their you know medical whatever then was you know let's do it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so it wouldn't that be the better'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so can can that be about alternative then animal testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah i mean depending i mean it just depends on the situation is you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it depends on the situation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just depends on each each situation but i mean you you don't wanna just take something that's just developed and give it to someone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean you wouldn't want it tested'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if we're gonna test on anything animals i know that they like they use the hair off of horses tails'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if we were to test i believe we could possibly like we could start like you said compassion if we were to start using our hair growth'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all the time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'serums and things and allowing them to take part in that to see if it'll help them animal testing could probably transform'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah well i mean we've already gone back to the cloning thing we have already cloned some animals and like you said why not just clone some animals and you know go that way about it because they wouldn't be i mean yes they're alive they're alive and all that my ex had bought an actual horse that was a clone and you could not tell it was a clone at all i mean at all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh yes i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what it had the same effect on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but but but animals still suffering in the end though so it doesn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i mean i know that but i don't know that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i don't know because i mean i don't agree on it but i don't know that letting a a human being suffer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what have you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm either i mean you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but if we if we clone an animal test on it what it had the same result as the as the original animal if we used it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's just hard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well from from that that clone that he had'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm there wasn't i mean there was no test or anything done on it but you know it it there was no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'physical or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nothing that even led to that it was even a clone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know i don't i don't know how to really you know answer that i don't know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it was real'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes he was very real and he he was he's beautiful he he he didn't do anything out of the you know out of the ordinary that a horse wouldn't do he wasn't anymore aggressive he wasn't i mean he was just a horse'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it's it's crazy to see that you know we have come to that point to where you know we've got a cloned animal and you would never know unless you were told that it was a cloned animal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct OK wow thanks for sharing it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that fire has come that far'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'abdul'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh just to see if i can get your time up to six minutes we're almost there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if we were to test we we've talked about ken animals and other things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and medicines as far as animal testing goes UM'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we expand and and we've talked to not to mention our carbon footprint again but this is just things that we leave behind we use mannequins and and people for clothes most of the time and i don't mean just like form fitting clothes but i mean things is as much as hats and gloves we could do additives we know that there's a different amount of things that the fingers are different but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what if we started uh how do you feel about starting a test how animals act in clothes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so sorry i've animals act'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in clothing how do you feel about testing clothing on animals'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it's not that bad it's just more of a nuisance as long as it's not detrimental to the animals health and causing them unnecessary suffering i don't see it being that wrong to them it might you know traumatize them at that but it's better than death or or illness or being depressed because they're stuck in the cage also depends on whether the animal social or not so if it's the social i'm like rats or most mammals then it's probably a good idea to keep them around other animals or other animals that they're species so they have that connection'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so they're not depressed and also argue that if they're not if they're not in the right state of mind then your resource may not be as good there might not be as accurate as you want them to be so like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well there's people that you know they act different in certain clothes so that is i agree with you there having them around their kind and they might be traumatized which would be fine in the correct suit for them correct do you do you agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so depending on like say the type of that the species'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it depends on whether you should keep it social so if it's a social species then definitely you need need to take into account the fact that is social and if you don't then that could affect your results of you know your outcomes if it's more depressed is a mean system might be weaker than usual so it might it might be more prone to die from your medication or the disease you're trying to test against'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you should definitely take into down those well being on welfare when you know doing these type of test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you want bear more accurate results'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK and do you believe that animal testing has anything to do with like the things that we say that they're not capable of for instance monkeys can't use their thumbs do you think that animal testing has anything to do with helping them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'obtain motion or functionality functionality and those types of limbs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i don't really see the point of these type of research like there's no point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh they're looking into that is there that i mostly don't really care they just want to be out in the wild'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
