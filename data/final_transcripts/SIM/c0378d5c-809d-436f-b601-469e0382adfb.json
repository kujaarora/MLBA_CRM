        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",

        "'speaker_3': 'a few years back it was mandated they had to have physical education every single day for a certain amount of time now that my child who is in school and i'm no longer in the in the system they have physical education like two or three times the week instead of every day so it's it's almost like they're like it's not that important when you're young you know don't worry about it just make sure you have that education'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm power into the sports education or physical education and if you look on the society in general from a european or especially from a german point of view you have the feeling the people in america they are lot more overweight than ours so it's so interesting that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the you take those arguments if it statistics say the europeans do more sports because they are yeah slim or slim'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's true so but it it's about system as well like how your system is constructed you have your education system is constructed like they also need to you know focus if if the child is not feeling comfortable starting all day so they should provide him or her a special quota for you know if they are they find themselves more comfortable playing any sports they should yeah push them forward to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we are losing like even after having one point four billion population we are not getting enough olympic medals it's because the infrastructure it's really it's really pathetic'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i can see that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's true yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they seem to have the key there UM but UM about the conversation at all in our topic i'd like to add i want to place myself honestly in the middle because my kid of course gets sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in school in private life and with me together actually i'm playing in once in soccer team with my son the oldest is fifty five and he moved twelve years is the youngest and it's very important for me because we have fun together we are we do sports together and it's about team building it's about daddy sometime there is a lot of important things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why i do this and on the same time i like to push my son little more in the school that he gets more more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'maybe the best word for it is is a drive or a discipline to really succeed somewhere not only make it and i think in sports and everyday sports you teach that because day by day you try to make one or two percentage more you try training your body you always push yourself a little more a little further and you're in this moment you'll learn that if you try hard'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'something that you can achieve it and the same success can transfer to the school and to the education process and if you combine both worlds i think you're successful and healthy person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like with the extremes the two extremes you were talking about in america where you have like those that are very very you know competitive and then you have the other way where it's like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'obese eating out all the time all that stuff i think part of that issue is that we we as an america stress that ohh you if to when you play this sport you can become a professional professional professional professional whereas it should be like you were just saying like it should be the you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the developmental aspect of it and not like ohh you're gonna become a professional and so i think a lot of kids get especially when they get older when they realize ohh i'm you know the chances of me being in a professional sport is very unlikely they kind of shut down and just like give up so i do think it's it's a in a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly i would like to i would like to add that it's not about just a you know whether we like we should encourage child to play sports just because it's it's a it's there you know hobby or whatsoever but they are making themselves healthy as well so as you said about obesity problem in india not in america it's not just america it's like global problem so if a child is playing sport then in early age'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we will make it a habit it will make a habit for them so they it will carry forward as as the age passed by they will carry that hobby with them and they'll you know understand the importance of health as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but it addressing nicole 's point wouldn't that actually be a point against placing placing sports just as high as formal education because of the the the the pressure or or the view some kids develop'",
        "'speaker_3': 'he'",
        "'speaker_1': 'regarding sports'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly that's why i think it's a big part of society our society to not drill the OK you gotta be the best in this you gotta be the best in this and more of OK you're doing this you're learning these live skills you'll get you know you're learning how to be a team player you're learning how unity all of this stuff is way more important than OK you're gonna play this sport you're trying to get the best out of it so that you can get this scholarship for school so that you can go on and play professional sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but truth and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's hard to win ohh sorry sorry ishan sorry you first'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so yeah it definitely makes society'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah one kid son'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': ''cause uh yeah so it would be very interesting for me to know like how you guys are what's your point with this like are you you know encouraging your kid for you know studying more or you know playing sport because this is just an argument what we are saying it's just a you know statements but what your actual behavior or what your actual actions are towards your kids i would like to know that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i can easily answer dad my role here was to on the on the on the con side'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i tried that with the money but actually i already placed my message that i'm somewhere in the middle because of course the sports is important for my for my kid for his healthiness and of course to teach him teamwork and discipline in life on the other hand for me it's very important that he minimum makes his a levels in school and goes to university or at least that he has the key to go to university'",
