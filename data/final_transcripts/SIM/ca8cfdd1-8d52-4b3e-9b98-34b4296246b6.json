        "'speaker_3': 'i mean there's some good things that that the job teachers or on the job experience which teaches you like you said and if you go also like in terms of like leadership communication probably also time management right you become more responsible so there's definitely some positives of having job experience over the education but i i still think like education gets you through the door and get makes it easier to get the job that's for sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the errors like that's the one they know everything because that's our late that was our our our our main persons child then you're gonna have someone that actually went to school for it bumping heads with them because they're like just because you grew up around it doesn't mean you went to school for it and it's like but i was literally trained to do this so those two people are just like at it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the person that doesn't have the degree probably has to find a new job'",

        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and nowadays though with like i said all the AI coming out you you really do need some sort of paper because you know you're gonna have a computer doing all your jobs for you for you know'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know they want to see some kind of commitment instead of somebody that flutters from position to position but no matter what you do if you have a degree or not when you get to that position you still have to do on the job training'",

        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think the teachers also good example i think i don't want a teacher who doesn't have a degree because you need at least at least with preschool for example because you want a teacher to have some kind of a of a knowledge how he should treat the cheetah children right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i have to disagree with that because the teacher'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but you can't read how to treat a child i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i have to disagree with that too because i've been'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because the teachers are given the curriculum to teach those children and just but like say the teacher is teaching something that she knows is wrong like she still has to teach it that way she can get in trouble for telling that child otherwise'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with kids every twenty five year'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would like for instance the new math i'm like what the heck is this that's not the way we learned it but i can get the same answer but because i'm not doing it just like that person did'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have my god'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's just after they did that thing with S animations like there was like two two like a year between one year and three years where the kids weren't allowed this was right before coronavirus i'm so happy they took those kids at school i'm no i'm not i'm not mad at the people that put this in a play because they're the ones that let it be known something was going and miss they had this thing there where the kids were no longer allowed to write in cursive or they would get in trouble and and then they had the math if you wrote the correct answer for the math problems you'd get it wrong you had to work by estimations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know how'",
        "'speaker_4': 'happy sign your name please write in cursive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'only'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's crazy i mean the way they do i mean how can you tell somebody oh like like my kid they did they did that they made him stop doing the cursive and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's really crazy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh start printing but now they go back and they get in high school ohh well we need to teach you cursive why didn't you just do that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because they keep finding stressful about that they can't find a check but nobody uses checks anymore'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but well let me maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i like checks but yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but let me let me explain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm and that that's a amazing because it it's it is it's like well if you're an elementary and middle school and they're like you need to talk to your parents those kids probably should have just started looking well they could have done to look at those teachers like hey my parent writes in cursive if you think that i can slide a note under her door like that you're crazy so it kind of put a damper in those kids being able to follow up with what their parents were trying to teach them because my dad he would teach me how to balance checkbooks and you know the older people they usually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'usually write in cursive so there was a point i didn't have to go through this but if this had happened when i was in school i would have had a problem to where when my dad was trying to teach me about my financial i would not have been able to read what he was writing and then and then when i'm in high school they're like well get ready for life and i will not have been like nope you guys but i couldn't live my life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'question what were you trying to say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i just because and you all disagree with me and i just want to explain to you my how i see like if i put my my child into school like say my eight year old child and i live in the whole day there i want them to be with somebody who who knows what they're doing and not something that somebody who learns with my with my boy how to treat them correctly i'm not saying the way they're teaching the teaching them for example math my math or english or anything it's just about how to treat a child correctly because you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you can't treat an eight year old like you treat an adult for example right and i think from the typological at some point of view this is something you need to learn and the way to learn it is to get your degree right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right but you can't you can't read how to treat a child i mean you can read it but each child is different each person has their own way of learning and i'll i would rather have somebody that you know has been around kids and and just hasn't read how does child how they should be or or how it should go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well not necessarily'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well another thing with that is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and personality'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'd rather be around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'somebody that's caring and nurturing instead of justice educated because there's some educated people out there that are excuse'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'snobs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well they do bad things with their education'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that are what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's nobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is there any chance though they're just booksmart there's no common sense'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i had teachers that they would tell me right right away like you know i don't i don't have a degree in this in this because in our school systems you'd have a teacher teaching math this year they might be teaching english the next year then science the next year and it really gave me a chance to see things like as learning opportunities not just for children but for for the adults too so i'm looking at an adult person and i'm like she's like i'm forty something years old so i'm looking at her and i'm like you're forty something years old they didn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'teach you this type of whatever we're doing like say it's like this type of math so now you're our teacher so the person that wrote our textbook can teach you and us at the same time that's great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that happens all the time especially'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well yeah but when i was in high school what they taught us like on some of the the like geography and stuff they talk of stuff but now they're finding out wasn't even true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so i mean they they got that from reading in a textbook or reading or you know what was written or whatever and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'isn't that due to also too the way technology has changed and advanced day of finding out things that they thought with the limited stuff that they had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so now that we've got stronger technology and stronger'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sign you know just everything there's so much more that we can find out and figure out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes definitely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i mean things are gonna change constantly no matter what i mean think about i'm in my fifties and like when my parents were in school compared to when i was in school compared to when my daughter just you know i've got one that's in college and she went to college during the middle of covid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'talking about being hard yeah i mean christian you said you know it teaches you so much other stuff but when our kids were locked in their dorm rooms and really couldn't go anywhere'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know what did that teach them is isolated them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and stop'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i see i i definitely see that i mean that's that's a really special case but i think like in general speaking there are there there there are definitely i think for personal development there are there are benefits of course if you if you can actually use them and if you actually benefiting that's that's another story right it depends also on the environment or which university you and and where you had also right i mean there's a lot of factors playing into that but i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so but i think i think a degree opens doors that not having one doesn't but i at the same time i think that on the job training it depends on the field that you're going into and what you're doing on what is more important like i'm not going to want to get to somebody to cut my hair who has never had training to cut my hair'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah true but i think like work experience can make you like a really good match for the job you're doing today right but like maybe higher education can make you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'force more important to advance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but she but things change like like they said things change every day and things that get you know you develop things and things get better or worse and so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or knowledgeable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how is that not you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i think but in that case i think in that case everything needs to be flexible and you need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i'm saying'",
        "'speaker_4': 'basically you can't be set in your ways you have to be open to changes and learning new things at all times whether you have a degree or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes most definitely'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i would i would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i wholeheartedly believe that because we're people and even though we've had so much research and families that have been here through so many different things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm phenomenons are real like i mean i even saying like religion or anything like that but like phenomenons themselves are real what would we do if like we woke up one day and all of the the leaves on the trees were purple instead of green when everything we've learned so far leaves to now we know why they're green we know what cells make them green we know what starts up to make them green and then now we as a whole place have to now work on purple instead of green'",
        "'speaker_4': 'threatening i would think a lot of us were on some good drugs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i hope never'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or what if we woke up tomorrow and there were no computers no TV 's nothing like that so you're back to on the job experience or training not reading or or having you know but it goes both ways it does it really does go both ways'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are that honestly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'honestly shelly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there will be so exciting like if there would be no computers tomorrow honestly honestly i think i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so your kids not glued to it all the time their phones'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think life would be better i seriously think life would be better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think it would be simpler'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think life would be simple and i don't think that we'd have all of the social media that brings so much stuff i mean think about it even twenty years ago'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we didn't have things i'm OK i go back further because twenty years ago we did but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know like when we didn't have cell phones when we didn't have where people could just take pictures and throw it on out there and things be misread and stuff all the time you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah well i think social media just makes you you're giving way much way more information of your personal life but it makes it so much more impersonal in a way as if you are just getting to know people face to face'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people don't know how to talk to each other anymore'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah true'",
