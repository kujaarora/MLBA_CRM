        "'speaker_2': 'i could really bunch'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i would honestly on the other end i'll be like yes cause i'm i'm a family person anyway so it hurts me to even say that i wouldn't take care of my parents you know what i'm saying but at the end of the day with everything that's happened i yeah it's no i'm not doing it but on the counter thing if they were loving supporting all that i would break my back to make sure they're good until the end of their times i i would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think that's why they they tried to frame this as a debate with with the signed pros and cons because we can all see i think both sides it if if somebody 's a screwing them with their kids and and making their life hell know they're not gonna want to take care of them but if they're supportive and stuff then their whole family 's kind of want to join together to keep the unit going so i think that's what the point of the debate when they were trying to assign was to force us into a position that we had to you know back up and and argue and debate about kind of like it was debated in school'",
        "'speaker_3': 'outside of that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i also think that the the the time in the era that we're raised in also determines that because if you ask my adoptive brothers and sisters'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i was just about to say that go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know that yeah that definitely has something to do with it because i was when i was adopted my mom 's youngest son was seventeen so by the time i was four he was already married and out of the house and you know i grew up pretty much i can only child but if you ask them would they take care of their parents hands down all of them would say yes they would all pitch together and they would all take care of mom and dad because it was a different time that they grew up in and you know they weren't they weren't taught to be so independent or free thinking like we are today'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and where it's then you respect your elders you don't talk back and you you know you do as you're told and and that that was that so i'm i'm sure that that has a lot to do with it as well you know aside from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being treated cause i'm sure i've heard the stories from my brothers and sisters they got the same you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'meetings that i did and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they would hands down you know my mother and father were saints and they do they could do no wrong so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i definitely feel you on that because i was gonna say if i was to have this conversation with my siblings they would totally disagree with me and probably cut me off right about now so i'm glad i'm having this conversation with you guys but they would have a totally different outlook on it because they don't care what she did what she said or anything they just know that that's their mother and they're going to do that you know they're gonna honor her until the day she died me i'm a free thinker i'm more of the free thinker so i think differently'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i have to be honest i i don't think we're giving'",
        "'speaker_2': 'them what the project is asking for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'while jim was thought us off let's we leave out you can lead by example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah and i'm not trying to be rude at all this is a very good great conversation but i've i i kind of want to get make sure we get paid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and it seemed it seemed pretty specific'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well like uh then if we wanted to assign me and john could uh me and jim could be a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know pro if we want since uh we haven't really talked as much and them being kind you know like cause i had already kind of seems like from their situations so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right because we're gonna have to bring up some kind of of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'conflict between the discussion between us so that we give them what they want they wanted a spirited debate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and what we're doing is is discussing rationally and being like just decent people you're right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what i said in my part i said that i wouldn't you know i said that i wouldn't be the one to take care of him so i gave my part of my you know so you guys know where i stand with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and say you did do the kind so you know hey even if you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know so that kind of equals us out anyway so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so you're saying that the children shouldn't be responsible because of potentially the way they were raised'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right there you go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right OK cool'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yeah and so you and i are going to be pro with i guess the counterpoints to these things i guess'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh so depending i i believe and not the stuff is necessarily what i i've truly believe but it's gonna be you know as a debate concept'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes gotcha'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that if you're a functioning adult then the parents gave you at least enough for you to to survive and grow into the person you are now and they supported you'",

        "'speaker_2': 'they gave you what you needed and the opportunity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they gave us like a home'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right to grow and if if they were able to support you and as difficult as it is raising your child then it might be i think it should be the children's responsibility to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at least after the same level of support to their parents to to show the the gratitude and that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they appreciate what was done because it's not easy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well jeremy if i offer the same if i i can do that i can offer the same support it wouldn't be anything so i now i agree with you on that i can offer that i can do that much'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i hear you do you think you should be responsible for them at all even if they spurned you and and they weren't the best parents you think that you still ship off of that responsibility as a a bigger person or or or have grown emotionally or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it's like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or more empathy is it would that be a positive thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no because in life i've already gave them all of that the empathy the chance to even come back and you know do things and and say things not even an apology just things so no i don't i don't think that i will owe them anything at the end honestly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is that based solely on on the way they treated you or is that based on just the general concept that children in general shouldn't know their parents not not they could but they should just based on on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't know having been raised should they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i i believe they should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i believe they they shouldn't know because um just just a lot of points that are being made like you know the fact that they gave you a house and or you know the fact that they raised you and this and that well yeah that's fine and dandy but what about there's certain cases such as mine where i'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'dealing with something such as being a homosexual and i want to come out to my mother and i want to come out to my parents and let them know because i'm tired of hiding and then they throw you out of that house and security and stability that you've known all your life to fend for yourself'",
