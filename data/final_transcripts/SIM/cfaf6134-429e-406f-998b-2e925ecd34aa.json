        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i'll start i do believe that a person should not be deemed incapable just because they could not pass a given exam by anything other than natural means itself meaning that if there were individuals or team that put a test together to find out the capabilities of another person i believe that there is a big chance that the results of that test are false and could be false and i do have other things to back that up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'things such as like a hearing test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the person could lie'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and you know they have those little beeps in the in the headphones just like let me know if you have if you hear this beep and the person could hear it but say no they don't hear it then we're you know giving them all kinds of treatment for being deaf when all they did was actually need a lie detector test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or running for instance oh yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so the biggest is disadvantage of standardized testing is that it is easy to interrupt it as students of school as a sole judgment of their abilities OK on a one single day of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our test or interview OK so this is too bad OK like a single day can't define a student 's future OK you can't judge their ability by taking a offer amp secure you can't just someone 's experience someone something just by having them answer a few questions OK they can't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to well OK schools don't provide the two pictures on students ability OK many people wrongly assume that the standard testing data provides like how much is child's intellectual capability but it does not OK like there are a ton of things OK which can recover on students perform there are cultural factors text and it unless like one of my friends is one of the best students i know of OK but he doesn't need good marks we have to nineties OK so this is there so you can't judge office ability by asking him'",
        "'speaker_3': 'your climate tree OK that is something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you for that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'another problem is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so with standardized testing i think kind of the the main point at least here in the US isn't i mean it tests the kids and those those tests stay with them throughout their academic career for the most part but it's really for funding the teachers have to have their students performed to a certain level for their own pay scale and then the school does for funding from national and state but the problem with it is that like i can remember in school'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two weeks before leading up to our big standardized testing that we did every year for two weeks we only did like practice tests over and over and over again they were teaching us how to test they weren't actually teaching us new information just how to test and that's absolutely ridiculous that that's just that's ridiculous'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how did is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well another'",
        "'speaker_4': 'another thing is another thing is too after being like on the PTA board and all that kind of stuff standardized testing is not the same across the board from state to state so if you have a school district like south carolina is ranked one of the lowest states in education but our standardized testing is in the top three of the hardest in the whole country'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so how can you take'",
        "'speaker_2': 'damn makes a lot of sense'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that is today there is also there is also pressure to teach the test OK if the teachers are pressurized they're not teaching that person information they're trying to teach the test together you have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're paid depends on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is there OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it it takes away from the regular education that a child should beginning because they have to focus on testing so much in order to get their funding their raises and everything else it also puts a lot of stress on them and let's face it some students and people in general do not test well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that is what is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if you put you in front of a computer and giving them a time and they have to get this tester that test it also tells them OK you may not test well but you may be really smart and not be able to go into those honors classes or those advanced classes because your test scores were low but you may be able to on a standardized test like that but you may be able to do everything else better than other kids who can test well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK it is also unfair to certain type of learners as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but then it goes with it works yes you have kids'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you have kids sometimes that just really really test well and so those tests put them into the honors course where they're kind of lost because they can test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then they have no idea what they're doing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're not they're not really getting you know they really don't know the things they're just good at guessing you know are good at kind of figuring out the answer from the context'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is also one thing there is also it is very unfair to certain type of learners as well there are learners with disabilities they are learners with students with ADHD there are a ton of students who are disabled OK you can't put across a standardized testing for that OK those needs special attention and special questions if our student have ADHD OK and if you they have to give an exam they're confidence will be broken like i can't have it can negatively impact the students confidence OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because of that because they will they will further induce or more test anxiety OK making their experience of test taking first test phone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i do know from work working in the school system that if a child has a special needs problem like they may take the test differently than just i want to say your everyday child like if a child has trouble like seeing the screen or focusing on the screen they may take the test verbally with a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a mentor and a separate room there are things like that that go on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but they have to have they have to have a diagnosis and i EP 's and everything else there's a lot of hoops to jump through to get that you know and sometimes it's not so much that you know they have a diagnosable issue it's just that they're not good at testing you know where they don't do well on written tests you know or whatever so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'why'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but the other thing is too that there's been studies done that show that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the wording of the test itself matters'",
        "'speaker_4': 'using it's very confusing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that not other buddy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know kids from a low income background they're not gonna understand what a parlor is you know or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hi'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know just different things like that there's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even like local local colloquialisms that are used kind of in common language that kids that aren't from that area are having been in that area along understand and then of course if you get immigrant kids that are taking these tests then it's really confusing for them because they can't ask somebody hey i don't understand this word when english isn't even their first language'",
        "'speaker_3': 'does'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK and then and there's also a standardized test totally like it depends on socioeconomic background of a person OK if a person is from a well to do family father doctor is a someone having OK he's more than happy to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'get good marks in such as asity there's someone who is from a low income family OK this is there because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because they have an education background at home everyone is studying everyone is knowing what things how to approach for this particular and how to prepare for these examination they have access to coaching OK this also exists to coach to the test OK many people are just practicing how to excel at those tests rather than acquiring those skills which will which are needed in the real world scenarios OK right now no one is teaching'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'investing cryptos how to do their access properly known knows that OK because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the only thing that because there is not just for that OK but in real world scenarios you need those information'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i think that i like like i i understand where the idea of standardized testing came from you know it it's the idea that everybody is tested exactly the same way so that there's no bias on the test it's not a person scoring the test you know they're all done by computers or scantrons well it was scantrons when i was a kid at least but you know so there's no bias there and they were finding that there were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'go ahead charlie'",
        "'speaker_1': 'me too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'after integration at the schools in the US that there was biased by the teachers against the black students still in those integrated schools'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then there was bias in the side of the the white teachers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now is there is bias against substantial growth'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm sorry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right now so there is a ton of bias against certain racial groups OK the immigrants are facing a ton of problems in the schools and other things OK like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah yeah but then the standardized testing was kind of developed to help stop that to kind of see where kids were were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah i mean it depends on where you're from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but there's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is a good argument'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hey'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and does it also doesn't work because it's not the same test given in every state so it and our teachers are so worried about and the testing and their scores and there's not just one test anymore there's multiple tests they have to do during a year it's and it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and it's not even it's it's not even by state'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct and with those standardized testing not being the same in each state'",
        "'speaker_3': 'plus'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK plus'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'by the test not being the same in each state just for my understanding and and i'm completely like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'pro were not worrying but proactively'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tending to the needs of students and this isn't just about children so it's about students this as an education period so it's like when we're sending these people to learn something somewhere or they've they've signed up to learn something which someone later on is gonna basically want to use their education to make probably'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i want to say bargaining not funding because i i think of things differently sometimes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i the first thing i thought of was that some states are sunnier than the others and then some of them don't get to see sun or like some states don't get to see snow so it's kind of like how could these key elements in nature have anything to do with how it helps a person actually work through things and it believe it or not it actually is the difference would probably be very tremendous'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK it is there OK and there is also one thing that right now there is a ton of focus on cramming up things OK there are students who are just memorizing things and they're giving the exams and they're doing very well on that OK they're not learning things they don't understand the things but what they get is just they just cram up the things into their head they just read it few times so that they memorize everything and just just memorize it and just write it away OK so that is the standard that should not be a source to see if a student is smart or not OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the goal of the standardized testing is not to find how well you think through the problems OK this is there OK it is you need to ascertain things like you can't emphasis on someones future someone talent on the basis of single sheet of paper a single paper based exam on a single day of a year OK you need to have a continuous assessment throughout the year to understand the childhood need OK so that is there OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my so my my daughter went to private schools and in high school because it was a private school they didn't have to do that the the state or the school district standardized test which to the point where you were making were not all state is is not all states have the same test it's actually not even all school districts have the same test because i lived in the in the county when i was young and i moved to the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you don't have to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hey'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm in like fifth grade or something and it's different schools school district same state and we had totally different standardized testing but anyway so my daughter didn't have to they didn't have to do the the standardized testing because they didn't have to rely on or they they didn't get any federal funding'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but if we get but if we go to like where people can get the the grants or the certificates to be able to go to private schools like they've been talking to so you can pick the schools that you have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at that time if the if the public schools are still doing standardized testing don't you feel that the price will be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well then they will yeah the yeah the school she went to was a a catholic school and with separation of church and state that shouldn't ever hopefully ever come up but but yeah but no but my my point is that didn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK OK that's it totally different scenario'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm also not a fan of the separation of the of the church and the state because i'd like to think that the same science the same rain that falls on the churches roof is the same rain that falls on anybody else 's roof whether it be a scientist a doctor a lawyer and i i do look at lawyers and scientists and doctors and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but separating church and state just means that i don't have to learn about religion when i go to a public school basically'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'huh that is totally true plus there is one thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but anyway that's that's sort of but anyway my point with this was with her going to that school she didn't have to do the regular standardized test where you fill in the little bubbles and everything but her school did testing every year the students but what they did was really cool is it was each so each of the high school students had like an academic advisor and that advisor would sit down with them and say OK you know these are the classes that you're taking each year you have to do a test for each of those and it's not just the regular tests that go towards the grades these actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go towards the grades'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so the standardize this thing doesn't provide any OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but you know so when math will go written test or in reading will do a a an oral test and that kind of thing and that really kind of helps stand that helped work those tests to get the same information'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that helps more towards graduation to see what they've done'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK standardized testing doesn't provide any feedback also on how to perform better OK the results aren't even go head back to the teachers and student until months later OK and there are no instructions provided by the test companies on how to improve these test scores in the real world scenarios OK there's also like ton of student teachers also know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right well push on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there are there are stuff that they get to help improve test scores'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but generalized in the general testing they it is not given priority background we are talking about competitive exams OK there are teachers also know that this course may affect their salaries and job security so they're also teaching the test particularly OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'also students know that test scores may affect their future life OK so they they they do whatever they can to pass them including cheating nowadays there is also a ton of performance inducing drugs are also there OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like if students are taking drugs to just cram things up and they make their mind chopper or something that thing also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah i mean how those those SAT the ACT and the SAT scores just to get in the college i mean those my god the kids just stress out'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't think our elementary because they're taking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a lot of colleges a lot of colleges and people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like they are taking pills they're taking pills for that OK plus'",
        "'speaker_4': 'charlene a lot of colleges have done away with the SAT scores in the ACT scores since covid'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is very good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everything really well good well i know like my mom didn't have to do the SAT 's and she got into saint louis university'",
        "'speaker_3': 'plus'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a star'",
        "'speaker_1': 'congratulations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good for the good for them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i was a little surprised that she didn't have to do the SAT for that one but she did have to do the ACT but a lot of them are doing away with that SAT i've noticed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but since'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK plus'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but my daughter my daughter my daughters at clean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which is good that is just mind numbing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK plus the latest doesn't value creativity as well OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my daughter 's at clemson went in twenty twenty'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they didn't have to take the the next class coming in the twenty twenty ones didn't have to take ACT or SAT ACT or SAT 's to get into school'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK that is it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where was that at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there was always at at clemson'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh my'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and most college'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yeah i mean i kind of assumed like she had applied it at UMSL and didn't have to do the SAT for that but you know i i kind of understood that i mean not that i'm just not a good school but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not as up there you know as some of the other ones but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well part of it was part of it was too they have learned that the kids that are coming in they are taking more of their grades and their extracurriculars instead of taking the testing scores'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wait'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and there is also standardized test doesn't value creativity OK if a student as an artist OK who who has a very creative answer OK no one has said that that it is not the bookish answer which we have told you to write OK so this is very different in case of artists arts and other students OK you can't judge someone on the because of the testing everyone creative expression will be different so every creative job or creative art should have a different parameter for testing instruments not just the standardized testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no not at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no not at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but see the thing is that it's not only like the arts and music and things like that that's creative you know even in business you have to be creative and think out of the box just in order to make your business success'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh that to to to monday a good winning product you need to think out of the box OK like that is there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean just writing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean you've gotta have that creativity and that problem solving no matter what job you're doing really and you're right it's not teaching them that at all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right now everything if you don't have math you're not going to do a lot of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK plus standardized test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK plus start with favored those who have a social economic advantages OK just companies which is a multi billion dollar industry they manufacture test they manage the courses and programs that can be taken to prepare for the test OK if you have money you can even get special tutors to help you do well in the test OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'speaking of which there is a test that i actually wanted to talk about they do like presidential and national physical education test in elementary schools and i remember them doing like they they they time you for the mile and they don't they don't set themselves any required like they don't hold themselves accountable for anything that actually needs to be held accountable for such as things that would actually make the test results more accurate the results are getting is just they're basically that there is no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not a haze of those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like they they believe they're doing an experiment that's valid but it's not things that would make this valid as things like does that child get to pick their food do they get to choose their own food and drink before or after the test so they can have the confidence of this is what i need to eat before i can run that far in that fast and this is what i'll need afterwards so i can actually have the confidence to finish it so i don't hurt myself or does the parent get to fix it to choose these things know what they do is they send the child to school with no note or anything to let them know they're gonna be running this they feed them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'school lunches the kids that bring lunch at healthy lunches from school probably do get better scores because they didn't have to go through a line and just choose things that they don't even know how to put together i'm still an adult and still don't know to put my meals together correctly to where it makes sense and and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but right here too the kids the kids don't eat the school lunch because it's disgusting because it has no flavor to it anymore so you're also putting it you're also putting a child out there who may not have eaten you're also putting children out there and i agree with you brittany that may spend all their time at home in front of a computer or on a screen of some sort instead of being outside getting any exercise or being out in the smoke'",
        "'speaker_2': 'getting exercise you know like when i when i was a kid i was a gymnast and i was extremely athletic because of that but i couldn't run a mile to save my life you know with it it's a different kind of activity you know what i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'walmart'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK there i i have a fun argument over here'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i was a sprinter in school and in order to run a mile i had to prepare myself'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK so let me just take you a fun argument OK stabilize this occurs in artificial learning environment they are time you can't talk to a fellow student you can't ask questions you can't use references or learning devices you can't get get up and move around OK these are the conditions in the examinations OK how often the real world look like this OK you can think real scenario you can't talk to anyone there's a time thing you can't talk to a fellow student you can't take help OK so this is there is only one scenario which i came through there are prisons where this is there OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'however'",

        "'speaker_2': 'there you go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so this is like an even or what their argument they're pushing us that these integrations prepares students for the real world OK the real world doesn't sound like that real world you want to have it you want to do your taxes you want to pay your bills you want to do things you want to answer something OK they're not teaching that they're teaching your bookish knowledge OK so that is not the real and that's why standardized testing is creating a ton of stress OK some kids do well with a certain level of tests other students fold OK so there is a ton of things with folding as well OK there isn't a lower level'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bank field OK like there is too much storage on psychological physically harmful OK my brother is a psychiatrist over in this country and he's telling me that the parents are coming to him to prescribe their children some pills so that they can be better at their studies OK see ya so that is a very different scenario they like they are telling like one of my very fun incident which my mother told me that one parent came up OK like the patient has a bipolar disorder they told that he is a like the bipolar disorder is OK now his mood swings'",
        "'speaker_3': 'totally fine but he's like not doing well in the studies OK then my mother told us sir i'm a doctor not a teacher i can't make it i can't make him too well in the studies OK so it is there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can't medicate stupid sorry that was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but you still can't you know you still you still can't expect a psychologist to treat you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i i do a kid that sits on the stoop all day long and does nothing as stupid i don't know about everyone else i have different views as those words like the the whole thing i know i know and i do know that there's a part of me that's different for this i just i'm i'm here i just have to keep being here as long as i can'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but as long as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i do i do get that you can't teach stupid if they are if they are determined to sit there and not learn correct you can't teach that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i didn't say that i said you can't medicate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK there's also standard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm saying you can't medicate it you you can teach anybody'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is totally true that is true OK plus there is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but you can do you can medicate them to where they are have the willingness to sit there and actually listen yeah i don't really like'",

        "'speaker_4': 'if you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i wouldn't really do what i would try to do the the most that i can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you you can't mitigate you can't medicate that unless it's something like ADHD unless there's a brain imbalance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'adderall'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how long'",
        "'speaker_1': 'which typically is what it is and and it's it's sorry about bare bad news but a a attention deficit hyperactive disorder which it definitely means that you're not paying attention because you're you're wanting to do something different that's literally what that that says'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that does it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no there there's a brain imbalance it it's not a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct because you're not doing what you want to do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no big because there's something in your brain not functioning right the chemicals aren't balanced correctly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your body is your brain you know your body looks good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's called nature that well i'm not i'm not i'm not being mean i'm saying nature like a person that is has ADHD they're being told that they're at their attention is on something different you have attention deficit hyperactive and i'm i'm a person who has paperwork saying this so i'm sorry about that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like feet'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and right now people know this disease particularly this particular factor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm it's it's if my brain is naturally getting if my receptors in my brain are naturally getting messages from nature of course that's what i'm gonna be focused on i might not be focused on the task that's put in front of me by another human being or a machine because i'm literally still catching natural waves from life itself that doesn't make me bad they medicate people for that i don't say they need to but in such a world that we need money so bad yeah we kinda have to snap the person out of nature and put them back into robotics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so we can get what we need out of them i'm not saying it's bad or good but that's the truth of it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see how they have faced till now like previously didn't know we didn't even know ADHD when we were students OK right now this this came into the picture now i can name certain of my friends i think they had at city at that point of time but they were not diagnosed then OK and what happened OK like like it's just taking a couple of this particular standardized testing OK if i scored well on the test they assume that they know the material OK but however this might not be true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK this one may have simply memorized the formula or have a trick mister cheated or something OK so but the person who had easy HD'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the other results would vary so much like it is very difficult for them to write something keeping their mind in a single place OK like so but even though they are greatly talented OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i want one for them to sit down and stay seated for an hour or two hours'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if if that is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that and that's what it takes to do this testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i know that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i kind of grew up when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kind of when that was starting to be noticed and diagnosed in children and my brother had ADHD'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and he had it really i mean it was it really affected him he also had dyslexia at a time when learning disorders weren't really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'diagnosed much and i mean i can remember my brother was not a stupid child'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'he didn't do very well in school he couldn't focus he couldn't test well i was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he was reading backwards he was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep all those things but i was the nerdy little teacher 's pet child and would bring home straight A 's when he would bring home D 's and F 's it got to the point where i hated even giving them my report card when i should have been proud because i knew'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that things were not going to go well for my brother because he didn't get those grades and it was kind of worse when they compared him'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the standardized testing for him was just i mean it was almost trematic for him'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you can't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'murder'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there was like murder for him it was just'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah he uh i mean it just ohh i still remember and then it would lasted a week long for us and i can still remember that week every year when we were kids cause he was miserable to be around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'often too'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK and there is this thing that standardized test failed to provide adequate measure of what they're supposed to access OK they are accessing verbal and mathematical skills OK but what they ignore is a much modular skill of range OK range of skills OK like that requires a person to function properly like the ability to work collectively the adjustment to change to function effectively in every environment OK to understand others perspective to motivate solve problems in real life context OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or standardized testing due'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bilingual bilek analytical ability leadership abilities OK there are no judgment to that OK these kind of abilities social interaction skills OK don't judge that they just judge whether he's able to solve math properly whether he's able to solve this thing the real world analysis is not there OK this is the biggest argument it's that in the real world argument is not there a person having ADHD he might have a great special abilities OK kinetic abilities leadership abilities'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but you are not doing any of that you are judging him if he can just solve this particular mathematical question which is very difficult and he has to do the other thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no and and that's where the aptitude test does come in greatly because as soon as he were to take that test they'll know that that might be a problem that he can't work through so they'd already hop on finding someone else that knows how to work that problem through and i'm not saying we should just ditch him and say let's not help him because i also think that it is needed for someone to jump in and help him through that but it for sake of being quicker and making the money possibly later and i would be one to pair those two together later on actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but attitude i remember in school i didn't i didn't i didn't have confidence in myself at all i didn't believe that i had a a place in this world to actually fit in or that i'd be able to help any type of systems go other than my own body or i'd be a part of any groups or a clubs or anything like that and i remember actually what the computer lab even looked like when i took my aptitude test because i took mine online one of them and i remember from that day forward when they told me what i just took what test i took'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it changed me to where i believed OK there is a spot where i can fit in there somewhere i can be successful i just have to find it and if i were to you know actually go back and find out and i transcripts what the answer to that test was i might be the person to go try go forward and get better in those areas but i don't remember what it said but it still has lasted this long to where that was the change to where i started believing that i could do something'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i that's a good'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i think that's a good thing my problem is with these standardized testing is our teachers focus and our schools focus so much on the standardized testing so that they can get the funding that they need that they are missing out on teaching and educating our kids on subjects so that we don't go back and like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the amount of history that they've dropped and stuff that the kids don't even learn anymore and if you don't learn the history history repeats itself if you don't take the time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah well so much of what they learn is revisionist history anyway'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if we don't change it it's gonna just keep going like a running ball but i'm we've reached out thirty minutes for this conversation so i'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK that's great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well thank you brittany for moderating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're welcome no problem thank you for participating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and for your your insights those are amazing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so i stopped the recording whenever you're ready you can push the red button at the top that says leave just try not to push the X up top so we can make sure you're paid correctly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK thank you for having me it was great debating with you thank you all thanks bye bye'",
