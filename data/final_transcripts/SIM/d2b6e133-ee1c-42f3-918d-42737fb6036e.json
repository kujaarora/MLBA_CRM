        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if you're really super common name you're going to come up with tons of information whereas if you ever really rare unique name it's only your actual own stuff that's gonna come up that's a bit scary'",

        "'speaker_2': 'that's really come on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i guess a lot of companies do have like a social media policy where you've got you're not allowed to it's usually vaguely worded and it's like you're not allowed to post anything that might bring the company into disrepute and that is totally open to you know suggestion or judgment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think there's a'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK you know everyone's got different values don't they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's whack just to like not be able to like post your for example a picture of you in a bikini'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because your kids might see it then i feel like that like falls on the parents to like you know monitor the kids because if a kid goes to the beach they're gonna see a bikini'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know what the issue is about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's not bad yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there what's wrong with the bikini if you've been in the german words and you've looked at your body and look good what someone posting the photo beginning or not or or not necessarily looking like that but what's wrong with it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah go for it yeah yeah same as like if you're if you're working healthcare is it is it really bad if you then post a picture of you smoking or drinking alcohol or if you post a picture on you're overweight is that not OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah exactly i think i think people can do whatever they want and i think actually what you said about like you know companies you know saying that that that shouldn't be something that they don't approve of it's disgraceful that's heading into some sort of dystopic you know nightmare at the end of the day like i mean we used to before the internet was the case of whatever you did in in your work was maybe you were judged on but as soon as you left the door that was it you were you know nothing to do your job anymore'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think we're samantha said about healthcare is also an interesting point and because i mean the question here is really if a company should be allowed to look into your private life right but let's say you work in a hospital and you make your selfie'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and on that selfie there's a an another person on there should you pull you allowed to to post something like that so the question is like where does your privacy start and where does it end right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think if your picture if you're like outwardly like trying to post someone 's face'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then no cause you're basically infringing on their like privacy but it's like they just happen to photobomb your picture and you're taking a selfie then like i guess that would be a little more different unless that's a person like i guess i've been reading too much but i guess like it's like a super private super ported person who doesn't want to be seen that they can like sue you or something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know that's like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can you sue someone for image rights i know you can if someone has like a contract with a football team or something like that but could you sue someone for image right just for a normal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'might be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it has been about if you've taken the photo in a public place and there's the general public are behind you that's that's OK but if you're in like a private place like a hospital then you you can't really have people in the background because that's not a public place'",
        "'speaker_2': 'really is that a law'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know i don't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i said'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i don't know i think as celebrity like sued for their pictures for their like pictures that paparazzi took so like i guess you can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because it is right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's why because when you're a celebrity when you're famous football you have image rights and so your image is protected and copyrighted as you and then like when you play for a big football team for example christian ronaldo real madrid take all the image rights for their players so they own the image rights because the image rights are worth a lot of money i think in those cases you have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the on your face'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i think your standard joe blogs in the street i don't know if you can sue for someone taking a photo of them i might be wrong'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i don't think they should be able to to be honest just we've got to remember right in life i believe right the most important thing is freedom freedom of expression freedom of speech freedom to be who you want and to do what you want and be who you are as long as you're not infringing and hurting other people i think we've got to be free otherwise what we what we bother and been alive for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah we we must be in the background of hundreds of photos like you think how many photos are taken on a day like us on this group are probably in hundreds or thousands of other people 's photos accidentally'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i agree but i think that like there are some people that take things to the extreme and what might be OK for you might not be OK for someone else so they might be like like take the delete that photo i i mean that like please so like you might be OK with it but someone else might not be and so issue like no we things like no like not a lot of people think like you so there's always gonna be some sort of like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_1': 'if umm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'i think it'll do it anyway what do you mean by should it be OK people will do it and actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think if they're representing the firm it's very different to somebody being on facebook you know on holiday with their family to being like i work for this company and i think they're shit that's very different you're very much representing the brand or the company but if you're doing something on social media there's nothing to do with who you work for but i don't think that should have any bearing on what your employer thinks of you'",
