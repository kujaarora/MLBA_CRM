        "'speaker_2': 'the idea of like just because you're working with someone means that they get to choose how much you get paid i i don't necessarily a hundred percent agree with that especially with like when there should be especially with minimum wage it's like a legal requirement i think like that needs to be in line with like the cost of living'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i just rented alone yeah yeah i i do i do have a counter argument though and i'm arguing with myself in this manner and that i i did run a small business for a short period of time i ran a restaurant and they they tend to operate very tight margins and they do attract well low wage workers lots of students in fact and i paid slightly above minimum wage and still couldn't keep afloat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ohh agreed or or there are other mechanisms like the threshold at which you pay tax is moved accordingly not not and and there are there are many factors in how you tax people but people are minimum wage are already being taxed through a vat system which is punitive vat is the worst form of tax of all the poor people they're taxed on income and then taxed on what they spend and they have less to spend than other people so that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i think that's a a separate sort of thing in in regards to like because the like you said that the sort of desire for a high scale high pay sort of employment environment but then at the same time the the idea that the people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the sort of essentially keep everything going that do the menial tasks like the bid men the cleaners the maintenance people like those that are considered like low skill and typically would be on minimum wage is still essential jobs and it's like just because they're doing something that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'no no absolutely yeah i mean where where would we be where would we pay that the the high skilled people still can't look out and see that the streets are filled with rubbish or that they can't get from me to me because there's nobody to run transport or that when they get old they're not looked by somebody who quite often might be on some of the lowest salaries you know certainly if you look at the care sector so it's very difficult'",

        "'speaker_4': 'what what what is that the issue is that there is a disproportion of that disproportionate amount of that money going to people who already have stuff you know people who have investment people who own the wealth and the poor don't have access to either a voice'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ended yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah i the pandemic is shown that in hard times the rich have only got obscenely more wealthy without passing passing that down there is an argument and it's completely discredited argument about trickle down economics that by giving rich people tax breaks they will invest more and poorer people will get richer that is utterly discredited so things like minimum wage unionism'",

        "'speaker_2': 'exactly yeah hundred percent yeah that that's the thing is like if you made that money you wanna want to but i i do think i do kind of disagree with with with the idea that like if someone wants more control of their financial situation they cause like start their own business and i think for two reasons that one someone shouldn't have to start their own business just to like be in financial control of their life and to the pandemic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah very difficult yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'especially showed that we live in a monopoly culture especially and like small businesses just they can survive if they find their niche they get their audience and they provide a good service that's true but in general smaller businesses will either fall or be absorbed by larger ones and i don't think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah they did'",
        "'speaker_2': 'potentially providing more fodder to that system is it's like a way to fix it'",

        "'speaker_4': 'hmm yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'brittany go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i was just agreeing kind of like that that is a better way to look at it kind of the small businesses might fall because when you're looking at fall a small businesses they're already looking to be in competition so that's gonna mark out some of their options to work together to make the revenue bigger between themselves because they don't seem to use really go that way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and and there is the that that competition is skewed if you take where i was for instance in the restaurant sector that is entirely skewed by the fact that people will spend most of their money on large corporations putting out fast food or identikit menus across the entire sector and the space for small independence is squeezed by that landscape it really is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean it it hasn't entirely put off a a vibrant independent scene where i live but it makes it very very difficult for the the smaller people and again that does come back to what you can pay people and again back to my argument earlier on that you have to have a level playing field when you're talking about things like taxation things like minimum wage because minimum wage is very difficult for the small guy and a lot easier for the big guy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's very true i i believe that also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well this also like i say counter argument where you could say that the outcome of an increased minimum wage might be a larger number of overqualified workers that are taking minimum wage positions and the result of that would be that you have a lot of young inexperienced workers that are not finding a job because there's too much or too many overqualified people taking it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what do you think about that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i see that a lot where i where i live i see i see very much of that i see older people that have been working in the same fast food restaurant for years and it's like them you see the kids that are like getting into bad things because they don't have anything to do they're being rejected from these places that the people that work there should have been progressed to themselves to a different position by now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the the the downturn in two thousand eight two thousand and nine and it was particularly bitter for me but what i noticed that time that there were people like me who had successful careers and were well educated and'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah well yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but because because that they were the only jobs they could get on that then disenfranchised is but i think what britain has said younger people you know who who were looking for their way into the job market and it was quite stark you'd be served by a fifty year old man at mcdonald's for the first time who was clearly well to do and well educated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that's like that that scenario specifically was like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'needs muscle of thing but i mean in in in general the the the like again it's kind of blue sky because then you have to trust cause the majority of the time like the the situation of raising minimum wage like people are gonna like the majority of jobs are with larger companies because that's sort of just how the way things are going and it's like'",

        "'speaker_4': 'that supposes that there is investment in development in investment in the education of a workforce and that regardless of size of organization doesn't always happen i've found that smaller companies are actually often better at developing their workforce because they see the need to fill posts as they naturally evolve as people leave people retire that's not the thing and i'm not sure for large corporations i've worked in sort of various sectors i'm not sure that it always works in a larger corporations'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they they they accept to churn and there isn't that a what george is talking about there that natural progression of the workforce which allows for people at the starting point of their career to come in up what what you might see is the bottom the bottom rung of the of the workforce louder'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i think the the primary argument in favour is that raising the minimum wage would result in higher earnings and improve the overall standards of living right but then comes the arguments against that is inflation rising and is is it resulting in more unemployment due to businesses needing to to cut maybe jobs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'salaries only make up a certain proportion of the overall GDP and the the lower end of salaries make up very small proportion of that so increasing the salaries of people at the lower end doesn't inversely affect the inflation rate or adversely affect inflation rates and what would happen is that those people who get more money at the lower end would then have more money to spend in the economy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so the the GDP improves on the basis that it is invested back into the into business by people spending more plus there's more taxation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so there's a company the country has more to spend on services through taxation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so it's a in many ways it's a win win as far as i can see i i think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with all due respect christian that the inflation argument is something of a red herring and it's a media lead red herring poorer people having more money'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'being bad for inflation is a a fairly unpalatable way of trying to prevent people getting more money at the bottom end'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think circling back kind of like you you've kind of countered your own argument earlier when you were saying like VAT being a bad tax for the poor but in a sense it kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it works in their favour with the inflation argument because like you can't have both because if you're if you're paying if you're paying them well and then they're spending the money then that's that's more of that that's more tax that's more money for the government money than that can be pumped back in and help with supplementing and things yeah exactly and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i just yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which is great but if you don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it and it's win win for the consumer is the argument'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you don't see them helping you with your company or if you're if you're paying like those people more and you're saying like they they can put more money into the economy if you things that make it like probably complained about it seeing those people spend the money on things that don't even further themselves or make them look like the type of character they would want working for the company even though they're still having them employed so it's like how long would you let that stuff pass or or how how bad could it affect someone 's like emotions or moods running a business like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that like i can see where you're coming from but the end of the day is like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i don't think any job should have control over what you spend your money on unless it affects how you do your job because like as long as you're turning up to work and you're doing your job and yeah i mean if you're spending all your money getting piercings and face tattoos and you're in a like a front facing customer service job then yeah maybe maybe that is a discussion to have with the employee but like in general i kind of disagree with that like i i can see i can see where you're coming from with the idea of like an employer being a bit bitter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but someone is like frivolously spending money that potentially could be helping your business but i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in in terms of like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i don't see the argument that the the the the poorest the frivolous though that's the thing my argument about people spending money wasn't necessarily on being frivolous it was buying better things more things you know being more comfortable in their life having a holiday a better car mod comes in the house you know better clothes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah so it wasn't it wasn't there that that they ought to be frivolous with what they get it was that there is more money in the economy for the poor people to spend because let's face it if the money stayed within a business and it was a large corporation that money would not be going back into the economy there will be an element of tax searching for the company but a lot of large corporations do not pay tax to the extent that they should so it's better in the hands of the workforce than the company owners'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because that that way it gets into the local economy if it goes offshore it doesn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm going back to what you said earlier ian about the inflation argument i think the other or the other side of the coin is that if a corporation has more expenses on their workforce'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they would put that cost into their products so like this you're gonna have an increase in price and you're gonna have increase in inflation so the net argument is does the work i have more money in their hands than the price increase in what they have to buy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a then again i come back to the that that is a that there's something of a rogue argument in that corporations will pass that on because they are profit taking at the moment many of them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there there there is an excuse being made of pandemic and war in the last two years three years that they have to put their prices up and they have taken large profit out of that they've not paid more tax on it or anything like that they've taken large profit and large dividend out of it so the argument that it's going to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a in the hands of the workforce and therefore inflationary i think is a hollow argument'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a book like others may have a different opinion on that but but having read quiet extensively on it i think that that is that we are being misled in many ways'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so of course we're bringing misled in so many ways and it's never i wouldn't say never but it's it's not always'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not it's not always worth knowing who or not even worth knowing but it's not always easy to see which way we're being misled from because it's like yeah having the money circulated locally or within the business like you said if you keep it within the business they might come after that business for taxation just to get it back circulating into the economy and which then would put pressure in different areas of that business whether it be the person paying the employees or the employees thinking that they're not getting the correct amount'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it's not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the i i kind of feel like the the bottom line on a lot of the arguments is like just a general lack of empathy within within the minimum wage raising thing because obviously the people that are on minimum wage will want more like a higher minimum wage because they know first hand how it affects them whether they can't afford to live or they like they're a teenager and it's like they're having to rely on other people or things like that like the people that are first time experiencing it i don't think anyone on minimum wage is going to be like nah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that i want high minimum wage but then like that's not a large proportion of the population and the large proportion of the population in like the decision makers aren't on minimum wage and they're not a lot of the time there's gonna be that sort of apathy towards it and it's gonna be like well it doesn't affect me so you know i don't need to make a change for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'help make a decision based on their understanding of it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i feel like especially like especially within like the UK governmental system i mean i haven't done a lot of homework on how it works but the general like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the general feeling of it is that you know you're sort of just born into politics you don't really see you don't really see people work their way up or like the working man end up in parliament or anything and it like that that's that's a major issue especially within the UK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that that that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that there are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there are two routes that there has been born into power'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and then here in the US it's kind of like frowned upon if you try to jump into politics or certain way and being being people that understand that that would take you even further because you even like if you can put input your thoughts and ideas then it would be a heck of a lot better to keep the ideas going around but they look at politics at such a bad thing most of the time here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i think like that america like the the the the negative look when especially it's like like i can't remember which campaign it was but it was i think it was the most recent so what was that like twenty the twenty twenty election with when bernie was running twenty yeah when so like when bernie was running and they were using photos of him like at the civil rights protest and stuff as a negative and i'm like how was that a negative i don't understand like he's a troublemaker it's like no he'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
