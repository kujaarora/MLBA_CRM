        "'speaker_4': 'yeah true exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i think i think there there's another reason why uh employers should be able to look into their candidate social media it's because i mean if you're buying a a product or a service online you're probably gonna look at the reviews i mean the reviews can still be fake or anything but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but you'll still be able to get a better grasp or better feel for the product and once you get the product you can you can reevaluate your decision or how you like it but you look at reviews to better understand or have a better feel so why wouldn't you do the same with people who you're potentially hiring who who you're potentially paying'",

        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'you know and then if you have a group of people like that as well balanced probably the decision is gonna be better than if you have a group of people you know of like to say it like a bit humorously old white men that's it there and make the decision so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'decision yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so so so but order to to do that you would need a a very diverse group of people in your company right i mean i mean especially if you're a a chinese startup i think that's gonna be harder to achieve'",

        "'speaker_4': 'less diverse'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like yeah in a less diverse community then of course it might be a problem but i mean the male female factor is something we want to achieve in all areas of society isn't it i mean so male female should be should be possible to do and yeah i i mean within your possibilities i guess as a company you're right if you're like in the middle of germany you probably won't have a a person of color to hire or'",
