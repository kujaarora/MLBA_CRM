        "'speaker_1': 'OK and we're ready to start if i could just start with uh sammy if you could say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you rabia'",
        "'speaker_3': 'quick brown fox jumps over the lazy frog'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK thank you very much so umm let's go ahead and start chatting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm the topic here is do you agree companies shouldn't be allowed to look at future employees social media profiles what do you think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm well maybe i can start it i don't think it's kind of black and white i don't think you can say kind of yes definitively or no definitively but you know i think that people in general should be very careful or very aware of whatever they post online or on social media'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and yeah you know to a certain extent i think an employer has the right to look at what the individual has posted previously to try and identify whether they are the right type of fit for their organization'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and so you know in case there are some i don't know homophobic comments or some racist comments or whatever that may make them not suitable for a particular role within the organization i think that's that's that clearly i don't see an issue with that i think where it becomes problematic is is when you may be looking back at something that was posted a long long time ago when the prospective candidate is was a child or a teenager or whatever else so i think that's where it gets in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but less clear is is yeah how how far back do you go and and how kind of wide and deeply do do you search so that would be my kind of kind of starting position i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that that makes sense like even if they are looking at those posts they shouldn't go that far i agree in this point but i think there is more disadvantages in this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the in this field because i think it can it can be like judging the book by the cover so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh especially as far as i know that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the human resources specialists are not recommending to put our photos into our CVS so to not create a bias because people can judge us by our looking by our race by our how we look if for example there are a lot of sexist cases like if if a woman is very beautiful then they just hire her or if she is not maybe they won't because these kind of things are happening a lot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i also agree with what you're saying uh it may it may be invite with our privacy if the company starts to look over our profile and and it could lead to discrimination if we if they found out that maybe if the case they'll they'll find out our religion or race and and they'll discriminate based on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right it would be uh they might'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'look at something in discriminate against a candidate is that the fear there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also it's a waste of time for them to dig over our past and see what's internet'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah they can save more time if if they don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i you know i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but maybe it can be helpful if they check their linkedin profile because it's a professional website about jobs so maybe they can see what did they do before or what are their interests and what are their success and their connections maybe this this might be helpful but the social profiles i'm not sure about it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i suppose that's the challenge is where do you draw the line you know you if you say linkedin is acceptable but you know it it just becomes quite subjective then what you know where where you draw the line as to what can be used and what can't be used and then and how do you police that how do you monitor kind of whether or not there is is looking or or not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in linkedin we chose to allow herself by looking but it's a different platform if you consider linkedin it's a different platform we allow the companies to see at our linkedin profile but we don't have the other profiles like facebook or twitter we don't want them to see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i you know i think linkedin is very much just a a recruitment tool so you know a lot of you know most people have their information on there are kind of searching and looking for other job opportunities or whatever else so but i suppose the question comes how do you stop an employer from looking at facebook profiles twitter profiles or whatever else you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah we could we could make it private'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean if everyone ohh sorry you go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we could make it private'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah you can make it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'should i OK i i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you never hear you you go go ahead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i was going to say like of course everyone is free to look at whatever they want to but the this shouldn't be affect their'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that your decision if they're recruit if they're recruiting the employee or not because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the information that they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'got from the linkedin OK because since it is a related way to work it can be considered but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for example from twitter the political aspect i i don't think for example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but so robbie what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it should be included'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no i and and and you know i think it's a very gray area but you can imagine a situation imagine you're trying to employ someone to come and work for for your business and someone has applied and you have a look at their their social media whatever it is twitter or whatever and you see that there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're you know they there's a lot of kind of hateful speech they're kind of you know being racist or whatever else and that's not something that came across in there you know in their linkedin profile or even in their interview of course that's gonna affect the way you assess you know you look upon the individual and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know if i was going to employ someone i would rather know that before i offered them job than than find out that later on so you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah from this perspective you i think you're right but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah because uh this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'kinda give give an idea about what kind of personality that person has so this is going to be like you you you know more or less like with what kind of person you're going to work with so you're right about it totally i agree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and and that's what i kind of made the point i don't think it's kind of black and white because i think there are some kind of benefits but at the same time it's you know how and where do you draw the line i think that's the challenge'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and so so yeah i i think that's that's the kind of key issue that we have because you know if as you say if we if you were to put yourself in the position of a of someone who is recruiting you know into their you know a company that they own or whatever you want to have as much information about whoever 's gonna come and work for you as possible'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you know from my perspective i think one of the biggest issues we have at the moment is there's there's not enough responsibility for people when they post things online and and you know i think there's there's different things here but people who post things on on twitter or whatever else they need to be held accountable for that if it's going to be something which is demeaning or whatever else then you've got to appreciate there may be consequences of that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know but as i say i think the i think the concern for me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that everyone goes through a stage where they they say stupid things and make stupid comments and you know when they're young and and whatever and it's how far back you you go to look at these i mean there have been examples where people have been cancelled you know in in public life because of something they wrote i don't know ten years ago or you know when they were sixteen seventeen years old and and that seemed very problematic just because everyone is quite immature at that stage but yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah i know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you're totally right i have seen that cases as well like as a grown up as that person is out in person but when you go back that persons teenage teenage times from twitter and you'll see like there's a celtic tweets there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but we are subjected to change over time right we can change our perspective over time even even if the person is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i take like racist in the hindus past he'll he'll change let's say you can i company can take and take into that account'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but but surely that's a red'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no but i mean surely that's a red flag you know if you're an employer and you know this person has behaved in this way or held these views in the past that's still gonna be of concern to you even you know and i acknowledge people change and people mature and you know things things change over time but if you put yourself in the position of an employer then then of course that's gonna make you a little bit more careful or you gonna have to think twice you're aware of these things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's a liability for the right here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but if you're going to uh uh eliminate people like this like in this detail maybe you're never gonna find someone to hire because you never know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i know that that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because it right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that i and that's i think that's the dilemma here is uh is you know kind of where how far and you know how deep are wouldn't a future employer be able to go i think the question is you know they shouldn't be able to look at any social media of the individual and i think if that's if that's the question it's very difficult to say kind of yes or no but but it's an interesting kind of conversation to have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so to try and kind of understand what the different situations would be yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if we start to look forward it will it will also the it will also affect us free speech right people can't really express the express themselves'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no that that that's true and i you know i i take the point that i'm imagine you follow a certain political party or you're a you're a follower of a certain faith and and the the employer is is different and has a different view or dislikes that for whatever reason and and may not be you know may not select you based on those grounds that is problematic and that is that is an issue so yeah now i can take that on board that that's clearly not OK but yeah as i say how where do you draw the line'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and and and the other question is how would you enforce this i mean you know as you mentioned before ramkumar you you know you can you can make your profiles private that's of course something you can do and anyone can do that and limit the amount of people that can kind of you know contact them or look at them but i think a lot of people are happy to be out in the public eye as it were and if that is the case if you if you're profiles aren't private then then of course anyone anyone could kind of search up anything that you've'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'surveillance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you've said or any any comments you made in the past so so yeah i just think it then becomes quite a challenge as to how how you would monitor that and how you would enforce that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right i guess that would be uh am'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the companies do have to have some sort of regulations i guess as part of their background check but i think that they can't really do anything that is out of line with HR protocol or law i guess so some of these things that do pop up from a long time ago'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i mean why don't people just hide that you're right we have a lot of control over what we share on social media but the other thing is there's different social media like you said guys there's linkedin that's a good place to show the good parts of yourself in work but i really think then to network and everything like that but how well here's a good question how what is your individual estimations of how much a recruiter or company will actually look into'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a future candidates profile'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it kind of depends on how critical that particular employee 's gonna be and what the the role is they're gonna play within the organization if it's gonna be something relatively junior or minor you may not spend you know much or any time doing any further checks than maybe you know the standard checking you know recommendations and and and whatever else but if it's gonna be a senior role someone 's gonna be quite'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'key or critical within the organization you you you may there you take more care in terms of how deeply you you dig in terms of references and whatever else and so so yeah i think it would vary dependent on on the risk associated with that particular role'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think if they are a small i think if they are small business it's more high likely to that they are going to that deep research about the employer maybe because because they will have time and you know they're gonna be like less people they're gonna spend more time together with that person maybe and they will have more time but if it is a big company huge company so maybe they won't have that much time because they're going to recruit a lot of people so maybe they won't have that much time for everyone to do this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you guys'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm brian kumar'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it also depends on the type of job right also the position that the person they're holding if it is if it is a more popular job like like take take in account if it's a job in google'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people were thinking to that post of that persons but if it if it is if it's just the blue color job they don't need to they don't need to go over the past and look what the person is saying it's just it depends on the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK that's fair enough'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah maybe it's maybe if it is a luxury brand maybe they i don't know i have no idea but i'm just making assumptions maybe they will be more careful when they're hiring people or they are like you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if yeah take example as a fadness product'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you if you if you had if you had a model who's racist yeah it will affect the company right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no no i think you're right if you have a brand that's built on say a quality whatever else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah it will also refer to bye yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so in order to in order to protect the public eye i think it's how it is said so they will have a they will have a certain image so they have to protect it and it's the advertisement is gonna be important for them so maybe they will make deeper'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah you wanna make sure that whoever is represent'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right right that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh research about their employees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'very true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and you can imagine if you're employing someone to come in as your HR director or your you know qualities minister or whatever else you need to make sure that their track record is is not you know they don't have loads of instances where they haven't been have behaved in a professional manner or have said things that they so again it's also about the type of role they're gonna do and the negative impact that it could have in the case of something coming out'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so but it's it's it's difficult isn't it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah for example yeah when when for example johnny depp had the the case with amber heard so he got cancelled with everything so he he didn't have anything because of his resume'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'essentially'",
        "'speaker_3': 'his personal life it affected'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's more than social media that's like the social media of all social media is being a celebrity and celebrity i ohh it's good ram kumar to say a couple more things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah very much so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and and i think i mean that there i was just gonna i'm just gonna say there's been examples of sports you know players who who have tweeted something when they were young and and as a constant goes consequence of that have been dropped from the team or whatever else and something they may have done ten years ago or whatever so it can be it can be difficult and it can have implications but i come back to the first point i made that you know people should be accountable for whatever they post in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'public domain you know make the comment or something or you're gonna criticize someone you need to kind of be aware that that doesn't just disappear you know that that potentially will be there in in many years to come yeah so sorry to interrupt'",
        "'speaker_1': 'marie'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no that's we're supposed to do that we just want to make sure everyone speaks like for six minutes each but yeah i guess with like celebrities and stuff there is the tendency for them to be trigger happy on twitter maybe and their social medias they don't have to make a comment on everything probably my guess is people wouldn't even make these comments i don't know they didn't have twitter or something something there's different ways to look at how and why people post but i think that the companies'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess i'm just kind of looking at it from the perspective of uh how much how deep the social media searches versus what is estimated it for it to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh and then with what is actually possible like with their laws'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm but i suppose'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah well i suppose i suppose that may be a good example is you know just typing in someones name into google and seeing what comes up you know that's a very simple way to see whether someone has got a lot of stuff that they're you know that associated with their name or not you know and and and and that may be a a simple kind of way to check that there's nothing very obvious you know that's just a very superficial kind of investigation that someone can do but i think we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i wonder if it company gives a they have their own tools but they may also use like a public domain searches or whatever i'm sorry public domain searches public searches like you said but i just wondering if that's part of the company itself or are they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you it does anyone know this in an HR role are you kind of on your own'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh as far as which tools you use for a candidate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to search'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i have i have no idea but probably they're just googling it because when you google the name you're gonna see the everything almost i mean any kind of website that you enrolled and you have a profile it's going to show up there and i think employees before applying a job they can do this as well and check if there is something disturbing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think the employers will hire a they'll outsource the background verification like they'll they'll they'll employ someone to'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'check the background of the person that they hiring it it happens in some jobs right there will they'll just hand out the verification to another person 's another company that yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'channel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but isn't it more logical to check their profile if you're going to check it anyway isn't it more make sense check it before you hire because if something comes up if you're going if you're not going to go higher'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah they'll check but but but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah i think i think i think i don't think that's a specific tool but i think there's some organizations that will do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because there is a the standard background check which i think also includes a social media scan but i'm wondering does the recruiter sit back there and start looking up stuff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'six'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on their own i guess maybe does this company have quote unquote people on it like we're all gonna be looking at your medias the frequently or stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe maybe they are using the kind of programming that finds the offensive and high hate words like so that they can detect maybe'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah and'",

        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no i was just going to say i you know i think i think we're all agreed that imagine if if i had posted something that was very offensive that you know i should be held accountable for that i think where it becomes very more problematic is when it's something to do with say my race or my religion or my political views or what you know whatever else which potentially is some sort of discrimination you can discriminate against someone because they're they said some horrible things or they were racist or whatever else but you discriminating someone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'may'",

        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but i i think that's the thing you know where where where is cause it becomes quite subjective as to you know when would it be what type of job would it be acceptable which wouldn't be acceptable and how much you know how deep could you look and how long could you search for and what and that's where i think putting some guidelines behind that that's where the devil is in the detail as they say just trying to kind of actually break down the the detail behind it is where it becomes more difficult'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'man'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because if you're already working for a company and then you post something that they don't like you can't be fired i know it can work for many different reasons they you can talk too much about your company you could divulge secret or you could just be doing something that does not go for their image but you can you can mess up and a variety of your ways but this is for potential candidates i guess the question is kind of nuance there the future employees'",

        "'speaker_2': 'this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah no i think it's it's yeah it's whether they can use that as some sort of you know a screening you know when you're like an assessment of potential candidate along with potentially an interview or potentially you know some some you know an application they've made in writing or whatever can you supplement that with some sort of assessment on their social media presence to then help make that decision as to whether you offer the job to them or not i think that's where that's the kind of crux of the question i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh ram any other thoughts'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",

        "'speaker_2': 'but ramash imagine you had it was your company though and you were recruiting someone to fill in that a position you you would try and you know minimize any risk you would try and make a choice which is less likely to be problematic so if there is someone who has displayed those those views in the past and there's someone that isn't even though the first person may have changed or whatever your as an employer you're still less likely to select them because they've they've shown that in the past and so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but in this case i think this could be the like the opposite way for example when you hire the employee everything is OK everything is perfect but maybe he or she will develop something abnormal later on how do you how can you guarantee adelf i mean you can never guarantee at all you can never'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now and and and as i think was mentioned before you can you can you can sack somebody or you you know for for for for for kind of you know posting stuff on social media when they are employed by you but as i say if you're trying to find someone to come into the organization you wanna make us as safe or a sensible choice as you can so yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'love it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a little bit like because when you when you when you're talking with educational education person you're on you're gonna understand the difference between the one like i mean when you speak with the people when you buy one by one by one by you're gonna understand the difference i think like because of the way they talk they way that they choose the words and everything and they had to do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe this can be more helpful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you mean like a screening them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'through their media'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm bad and i think you know i think in that situation employers probably in a better position because they're trying to find out whether everything that the employees told them is is at you know truthful everything they've submitted to them is is accurate because if you find someone isn't being honest or truthful then i think that's a very good basis on which not to offer some on a position but i think this question is probably taking it that step further where it may be something completely innocent about which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'team they support or which you know political party they they prefer you know which you know shouldn't be held against someone you know in the same way that you know race and gender and age and whatever else might you know shouldn't be kind of held against someone but but yeah i think that's where it becomes a little bit more complicated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure and and i and i think there's you know legal you know legal requirements in place that you you don't use that way in in various in different countries but you know that you can't you know you can't not select someone because of their race or their age or their gender'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so i think i think there are some protections in place for that but but yeah these other areas which are probably less less clearly defined it's it's a bit more of an issue'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right many interesting aspects to this question but really i guess i would say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no they should companies should be allowed to look at future employees social media profiles but you're right with all the UM'",
        "'speaker_1': 'protected things that we have uh on each'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah in in a reasonable way they should do this'",
