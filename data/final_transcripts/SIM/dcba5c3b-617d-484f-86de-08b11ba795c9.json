    "Should standardized testing in education be abolished?": [
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so my name is nikita and i will be your moderator today before we're gonna start this conversation i would like to test everyone's audio please say the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'great'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah great so everything works and the topic for our today's conversation is should standardized testing in education be abolished'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do any of you have like really strong opinions on this subject'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i do i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK please say them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'charmaine feel like go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well i was uh nikita and i were kind of kind of talking just a minute ago and you know i was saying how am i think there are both'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah sure sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a positive and i have negatives on the subject for instance with my negatives i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm the reason why i feel it should be abolished is because these tests are really expensive to take'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so therefore you know only certain people would be able to take these tests so if you don't have the money to be able to take the test then it seems like it can get kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm like elitist or classes or you know even kind of races in a kind of way because then you know only like poor people would not be able to take the test and only the rich would be able to take the test so that's why i kind of have a you know a negative opinion of it but then with my positive opinion my thing is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'by taking the test umm you know you'd be making sure that the students are learning you know what they're being taught so that's the positive of it but then you know i have that negative also so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's that's where where i i tend to disagree with that because the these standardized tests really what it's it's it's it's really only determining that which students are are good at taking tests basically because you're not you're not tested on or retested on what you did poorly the year before'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's it's a flat test everybody gets the same thing it's it's graded by either a machine or a blind reviewer that's that's going over the results but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and and that's the positive of it yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right and and there's well and there's a lot of other other factors in there why i believe it should be abolished because it if you're going to take a test imagine you're in school you're going to take the standardized tests and let's say you wouldn't even remember that they were coming up and now you're under this stress like oh my god i have to take this test'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or if you're hungry that that also influences you know things as well just you know just basically different factors that can go into that if you're tired if you and your teacher do not have a good relationship you know they're all these things can factor into how well you're going to do on that test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i i don't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think speaking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'david please'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think speaking always point yeah yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'speaking on regardless point i think this kind of standardized test should be abolished to be very very sincere because from a students point of view these tests are not actually testing the students ability because it's more or less like the students just have to read to pass the test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not showing whether the students is versatile the areas where the strength is good what the student is able to do and what the student will be able to do so if a student who is not smart is able to read for the test and pass the test'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he's happy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then it might be considered as an elite now imagine a student who is not good not pass the test pass until like an SAT then he studying engineering which is not really good in engineering then it's university schools we not reflect this test call because we won't be able to catch up compared to other students who didn't really prepare for the test or didn't get well on the test but would have excelled more in engineering they would have they have more broader ideas about stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and even comparing looking at what elon elon musk said about his kids he was like he's gonna homeschool his kids because most school are not teaching students on how to excel in more or less things of life they just want them to pass just teach them how to pass the exams and how to move forward with school work are you catching me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well it masks is saying that because you have billions and he can hire a lot of you know people to to teach them everybody else pretty much can at home school kids all like i mean you need to have certain means in order to be able to do that but but but guys the idea behind the standardized testing was actually to remove prejudice because kind of like you need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it's true it's true but people always true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'test all you know but have some kind of exams on students but at the same time you before that we had the system when you know it was oral examination so somebody 's gonna come out and answer the question like on on math or english or or anything like that so standardized testing was actually an attempt to remove the prejudices so because of the race you know income and all these things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but then it's it's yeah but then it's it's doing now opposite you know because now a lot of people are are asking for the standardized test to be you know abolished because they feel that it is showing racism elitism classism because you know only certain people can afford some of the tests so i guess it's kind of doing the opposite of what it was supposed to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know what i'm saying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i mean i can see how you know it arrived to that and yes if you have if you have to pay for this test that that's clearly an issue but you know at the same time like if you would have to come to you know to the board of i don't know for example white professors and explain them why you know answer some some questions and to argue for the answer to the question'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it is yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you never know how much of their decision or how they're gonna grade you will be the part that you know they they they they look differently from you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah well and also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so the idea there was like if you haven't test like nobody can see you that's the number that just at least with answers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but for reals though for us to stand the test are being abolished little by little because if you look at the way people have been going with this online learning when you can learn on coursera and other application youtube and everywhere people don't need to write test anymore'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can be a software programmer by just watching youtube videos and if i'm very good through my imaginative my creativity i can move on to apply for jobs what are they going to ask me for the jobs interview can we see your past work what have you uploaded in detail so the test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would not really matter but look at the student who studied to pass a computer science test and got a decree a bachelors in computer science is very good with the test it passed it has a first class degree but the can if defend the result with this program is skewed some will never wrote the test'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would it be able to do that because it's like uh yeah i'm good i'm a freelancer then the thing to make money more than people that do take the test and it now now the school format and school structure is just that when you pass the test you smart enough to go to the next level'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but with the way the world is revolving now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you don't need to pass the test to move to the next level you can let basically anything with the right level test anymore'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's right there's a lot of hands on education out there that that's that a supersedes the the education that you learn in theory because a lot of you can learn the theoretical stuff but when you put it into practice it they may not know exactly how to put it into practice but again getting back to the standardized tests'",
        "'speaker_3': 'everything is just polite'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but but not everything is a practice'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly no that is correct that is correct however i'm i'm speaking specifically in the computer programming field because that's something that i was very interested in and and seeing how many computer bachelors of computer science graduated with their degree and we're struggling to find a job whereas a couple friends of mine who went to these boot camps for computer programming got hands on experience they made some websites they did some work for other companies they were hired almost instantly out of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'graduating that that class because they had the experience'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK the the they could show something what they have done yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they could show something exactly and and that's the thing with the standardized testing is that if you're testing for these things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if there's something you did poorly on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's not something that they because it is a blind blind reviewer or because it is a machine reviewing these things it's like what what what are the student do poorly on the year before let's retest him on that and see if they if they learned anything there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but yeah but yeah because it doesn't it doesn't measure the progress it doesn't measure the progress you know and it doesn't improve the the the performance so i mean what's the sense of you testing because if i'm gonna test and it's not improving you know or it's not measuring the progress and it's not improving my performance if i'm testing i wanna know you know that something is gonna improve my performance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think i think the distance should question'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so why should i waste my time doing it if it's not going to give me that type of result you know that's that's my whole thing with these standardized tests you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but OK if not test then what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i think i think this should be more productivity the test the the there are different ways the test can be can be conducted it should work on the productivity of of of a learner of a student'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not is ability to the crown it tells you to really taste book is productivity on real life basis'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the OK how do you measure productivity'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i think really you should'",
        "'speaker_3': 'productivity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm sorry i think it really should should should take if they're gonna do these standardized tests take the extra time to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'review the student scores of the year before'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they take the test and then modify the test that they're going to take two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to check on those specific areas where they did poorly to see if they've learned anything new or to see if they still need help in that area so they know what to what to work on during the year'",
        "'speaker_3': 'students can even go for internships student can go'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but he isn't it on the student and on on the teacher'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on the teacher yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because they know these tests and kind of they know what they this student needs to learn'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they also yeah they know exactly what their students stands in their class so i mean they should they should be proactive about it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that's the that's the good that's the good thing about it you know that's the good thing about it because you know when when they're you they're administering these tests it's also showing the good thing is is showing that the teachers are lacking as well you know so that's my whole thing with it you know yes they're lacking because they're the students are obviously not learning anything they're not learning what they should so to me that's the good part of these standardized tests'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even schools can allow students to go for intention'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah the DJ 's also have tests for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh but to me just that part of the good just doesn't outweigh you know the negative for me yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the bad part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so as i say as a what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean that sounds really interesting but OK maybe we return to the david 's points about the productivity and kind of like it's now two natives to this standardized tests'",
        "'speaker_4': 'either'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah the student should go for internships if you go back for internships they go for area of their specialization they see how it works in the modern world they see how things really goes on by the time they come back to school when the teacher asks them about their knowledge and what they came from all these internships and stuff like that they will be able to share they have things to share the black yeah i've really done something then it people will be able to see and analyze the student that OK this is a strength'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and this is not a strength so all we studying engineering and went for internship and doesn't like the mechanical work of engineering feels like ohh it's too empty i can't do this work it's too dirty then someone like that the lecture will know that no this person is not fit to do engineering because someone someone like they can write the test and just get straight days'",
        "'speaker_3': 'street easy but physically when it comes to reality'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but does it mean that the that the teacher of the student gonna make the decision'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is the student you know good for mechanical engineering or we should he go for i don't know electrical one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah when when when you go for internship when they go for intention and they seem different practicals even in schools and everything the student themselves will be able to defend in their mind that ohh yeah this is where i meant to be and as a work of the lecturer on a teacher there they're work is to monitor the students and so the progress of every student so through this they will know that oh OK i think this is where this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'strength is lacking let's advise him because if it's true it is true you know the true cap of capability of a student through it you just know it's academic brilliance but you won't know it's effectiveness'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which should not make the student productive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like because of the proof'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but what if what if the teacher is not performing up to up to standard either what if the teacher is not performing the way that he should or she should you know if she he or she you know is not teaching the student the right way or the the way that the students should be learning so i i hear what you're saying but there there there should be other ways you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but data'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh their prejudice'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah well to this to this is after the test after the test after test isn't is it a teacher that gets the blame or the student'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because the teacher can say ohh i thought them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well actually both'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but the teacher can say i taught them but student i didn't really bright'",
        "'speaker_1': 'both yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which means everything 's death falls down to the ends of the student'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because the students gets most of the gets the stress the psychological stress the mental stress the emotional stress'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the student asked to write a test in the field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think our main focus should be on the student'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's a so you you think it could be like more shared with the educational facility and the the teacher and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kind of parents and everyone around them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes well the the yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think yeah everybody should be involved yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but but guys we are talking about rather ideal situation when you know everyone is involved and everyone is doing their job but real world is not that great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it but in the real world yes no it's not yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'parents don't always have the time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can we think of something more to the real world thing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh plus the school can actually grade student based on the practical works they do inside the school and the one they do and the internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that it's done in i think in UK where students goes for internship goes for internship in the middle of the school and the school gives them a report they have they have to write the report back'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and submit the report back to school this school grade them based on the internship they have to defend the internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they also defending internship this like this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK are we talking more like high school or is it university level or we which level is that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think you university live i'm talking about the university level now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK OK uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm talking about the university level now and even in high school if this if this kind of this kind of situation can be brought to the high school where students are getting used to internships right from high school where they just maybe an hour or two outside where they learn and they give a report in school and defend where the teacher greet them and see how they are doing that should be enough'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for us to be able to test the students not giving them an exam for any student that wants to do engineering is studying is reading about logical which he has to pass in order to be able to enter a school for engineering'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know my my i don't and i don't know if it would if if it would work this way but my thing is is is it possible that maybe on a weekly basis you this the teacher could give like a a a test you know a progress test to see how the student is progressing from week to week without it being just a kind of standardized kind of test because that's the only way that you're gonna measure a student 's progress is maybe if you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'give them a test every week what you've taught in the class maybe at the end of the week you could test out that student to see if they've actually learned the curriculum so i i don't know like you know the key that said in the real world if that's if it would work like that but in in my world that's in my ideal world i would like to see something like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i me too i i i just know to too many you know kind of high school teachers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that's a good idea'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but they they they will strongly disagree with you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly they would yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but but but but but yeah theoretically then we also need more teachers and that who will walk more individually with these students'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that that that would be great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think even before a teacher is employed a teacher should be assessed only on his productivity what he can actually offer this to them not someone who's just gonna give them notes and timings and they don't pass just fill them eight teacher should be someone who can communicate to the student which the student will be able to park their mind to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but that's the contradiction here because on one side you need a lot of teachers to implement such system that they will be working more individually internship but at the same time like you're trying to raise the kind of bar for them to earn to and to become this the teacher'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so on the on the school part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you need a lot of teaching but you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and this is yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the more teachers that you have the voice that will be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and this is where it comes in that you know a lot of these teachers a lot of them are so underpaid you know they they are so ridiculously underpaid i have relatives who are teachers and we will get together and i will hear them talking about the things that they have to do even supplies they have to buy on their own for the students and they're so grossly underpaid so i think that's you know if if if we could make a start there where maybe i don't know if it's the government that would have to step in and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or the union or whatever it is and maybe do something about getting these teachers better pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at i think then that's the the teachers would be more motivated if they're getting paid what they should you know but right now these teachers are not getting paid the way that they should so if i'm not getting the kind of money that i i i should be getting why would i be having any kind of motivation i mean let's let's keep it real'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'teachers the teachers are very very important in the life of the students because they are like role models outside the parents are the role models inside the teachers are the role models outside and if the teachers are not able to train the students and they're very right way and proper way that suits the current world that we are right now because it is more or less like a technology world now so but teacher is not well equipped even if it's not of sound mind to even teach then the students will be lacking behind'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah there there should yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which is which is one of the things that affect the people from the lower class and the higher class because the people that take their children to their expensive schools the teachers they are really trying to perform and meet up with the standards of the school so the government needs to intervene and pump more money into the educational system because the teachers the more the teachers get paid the better the output on education'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'roll please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah another thing i was going to say is that in the united states the these tests are made'",
        "'speaker_4': 'each state makes their own test so it's not necessarily'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know good statistics to to use because each state has has each state has a different test that they're using and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they they can vary greatly from state to state and exactly so like it it needs if there's gonna be some sort of standardized test should be one test straight across the board state to state if they're gonna continue to use this as as a method of of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right and it right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of measuring progress'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know which again i don't really think it does but unless you're taking to consideration past tests and and you know previous learning but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it it's definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't you think that it will more kind of will show more that you know there are are better schools within more in richer regions and there are more schools in poor regions and yeah and if it will have like one standardized test for all it will really will make the students from the poor regions even kind of throw them under the bus even more than they already are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's it and the poorer areas yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'dad i was lying to look some of the tests should just be concerned students should be should be scaled and tested based on their abilities based on what they are given in school what they are doing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but but but don't you think if it will if it will cancel the test the students are they even gonna learn something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how do you know that they're gonna progress you know i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the strains are gonna learn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's like we always say like yeah i i i'm i'm i'm going to school and doing something and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because the thing is the pen is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'within it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we are made to say that the test is a way to know this progress'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well well you know that's the that's the thing though is that that that standardized test is not the only measure of of progress that we have throughout the year it's it it doesn't all come down to that standardized test you know it's we're we're graded throughout the year and as students we have tests that we take on a weekly basis and sometimes on a daily basis depending on on the subject but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no it doesn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's you know it's it's something that's measured throughout the year so if the teacher is doing their job and and you know grading their papers and making sure they're keeping track of the students grades in progress then that should be that should be plenty to you i would think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'progress yeah umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well well but then again we're coming to this you know problem that we all put in on a teacher like teacher teacher teaches the student then the same teacher will you know give them tests then the same teacher will check this tests and then most likely then we'll find out that the total load and that the students are great and everything is is very fine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cowboy like when we're starting to compare them from different schools from different teacher to teacher that then usually we can see that you know it's not that fine that there's students are different and it varies from school to school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that is correct yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that's what happens yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know that that is correct but again you know that that's the thing though is that if you're gonna be a teacher'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that is true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're passionate about it then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know didn't do it then do what you're what what you're there to do i mean there's teachers that go to go to be a teacher and they just have no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'drive they have no they they they've been burnt out by the job you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but then it right but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's gonna just a job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but then yeah but it again it comes back to again the the pay you know a lot of them are just burned out they're they're they're dissatisfied they're unhappy because of the the the pay situation a lot of a lot of teachers are you know they love being teachers but they just feel that you know they they deserve more and and i've and i've heard it personally and they do and they really do but again it it it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they do and they do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what you put into something is what you're going to get out of it and and and i think my thing is that there needs to be some type of intervention on the teachers part not just on the students part because if the teacher is gonna put out their best then i think you're gonna see that transferred into to what the student puts out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly there should be some sort of accountability'",
        "'speaker_3': 'industry that's hundred percenter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but you know we could we we don't you think we are asking a lot from the students like many of them are young people and they don't really know what they want'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think the government should'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i didn't know i didn't know what i wanted to do when i was going through school you know i didn't even realize what i wanted to do until'",
        "'speaker_3': 'love is today don't you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't even think i still don't know what i want'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i agree about that it's like i do something but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i still haven't found my niece you know i still haven't found that that perfect spot for me yet you know that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and sometimes that's where the teachers come in you know yeah they they they do they'll give you ideas yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah actually there's nothing wrong there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's nothing wrong for a student not to know what he or she wants to do at at a very young age'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's the job of the teacher to keep teaching and train them all around they evolve we we are student we evolve gradually today i'm a wake up i want to be an engineer then evolve and get find interest i want to be an artist i want to be this exactly so it's gradual'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think at some point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah then you go to engineering school and then you you realize really fast how it's not for you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that's a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i mean i i've had teachers asked me growing up you know well what is it that you want to do what do you wanna do when you grow up in that type of way and you know and and they'll encourage and they used to encourage me well you know you can do anything you want when you grow up but you just have to work hard at it and these are the kind of things that i love with teachers and you appreciate with the teacher you know but if the teacher 's not getting paid properly i mean do you really think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly it's gradual it's gradual but if everything is based on test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that this teacher is going to put out their best they're going to give it their all i don't think so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know and and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i think at the end of the day'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i guess more money for education that that's the solution'",
        "'speaker_4': 'definitely is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah more money for education and the government should make sure that the government should make sure that the schools that are that are open they should be inspected they should be it shouldn't be a low budget school school where they employ people that are not even qualify to teach or people that don't have passion for teaching because that is very needed because if those are not done the question is what what kind of students are they expecting to produce in that school'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'alright'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they they they put it to me that would be nice except student that are exceptionally good themselves'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have fun'",
        "'speaker_1': 'here you go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and the probably the parent are performing that take care of the two'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well do you think then we kind of we need to rethink how we are making teachers never like some special education for teachers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and because we have some now but it's not really that you know mandatory'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would think so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well and another thing too is not just sunday academic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'part of the part of the teaching but i mean as well as like preparing kids'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and maybe in high school like you know starting in high school preparing them for what the real world is going to be like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what it's going to be like to pay bills what it's gonna be like to to work a budget what it's gonna be like to you don't have a job and and not much time for yourself as you thought you would because you know whatever factors came into play and now you don't get to do what you wanted to do but i think that like some life skills would definitely be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a valuable valuable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'daddy's very important very very important very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do you do you think we're gonna have a standardized test for that like here is the hundred dollars and try to i don't know pay your bills or something something like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right like i i mean we i mean we did that in in in school we did that it was like a a a life it was called life choices and and it was it was a class that taught us had a budget that taught us how to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know manage our money how to how to balance a checkbook how to you know do all this this kind of stuff and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'keeping receipts and how did your taxes it was it was really intense on how to do all these things but i think it was i learned a lot from that and because of that class i you know i've i've'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have myself on a budget and i don't spend more than beyond my means you know i'm i try to stay as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'within the within the black so they say you know i'm we're rarely try to fall into the red and and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's it's helped out a lot and i think that would definitely help kids as well you know aside from just these standardized tests that that are measuring academics but you know if if we could prepare our kids like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but you know guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes actually speaking on this point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know you know that's they're not only for students they also for you know universities or for you know future in plays that somebody can come there show that i have you know that much on my test and then consider to be employed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah speaking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah speaking only rose point though'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'speak yeah speaking on rawls point about the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do do you think it's still available'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's symbolical in some cases though but let me first click on raul 's point about the the the cause also did something like that in varsity and entrepreneurship cost where they teach you about real life business business plan day-to-day entrepreneurship acts and everything even after that we do practicals in that we write business plans we write ideas and everything just to train us an outright a good business plan outright exams on that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'please continue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the the difference is the exam whether you feel it or you pass it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh you still write it you feel it but you still keep doing it everywhere which makes you improve'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well no but but business plan is a whole could be rated really well like you know this is great part of the plan this is not as good i mean like why not read business plans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly and speaking on the speaking on it brought in the student idea because after we do this kind of course you see students coming you i have this idea on this kind of a business that will make the lecture and speak with the lecturer explain how they can move the business we see from there different student at businesses inside the school personal business to make extra money because it's something practical'",
        "'speaker_1': 'good idea'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they're learning it in class and they can easily utilize it immediately write in school'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well OK the counter the count argument to that would be that you you will have the whole life after the school to be very practical it pretty much the only thing that you will be doing will be practical and the idea that that's the time when you're getting any theoretical knowledge any abstract knowledge is actually the school'",
        "'speaker_3': 'which is a total advantage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you you experienced you have a little bit you all you have experience because you would have dealt with people like look at the case of someone that is telling someone who sells like beverages right so who sell beverages in school to student is technically gonna meet student who are not able to pay at that particular point in time is going to meet students who can buy essays is gonna meet people that will be shot in cash and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and he's going to meet his friends that we want to just take things for free'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that is more or less like the playing war that is going to get outside so the way he's able to manage his business and his business doesn't crash inside the school will give him an idea when it makes a bigger challenge in front of him outside the world he will know how face something similar i think i can be able to do this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but not everyone is gonna be a businessman'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so someone who doesn't have an excuse'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know like you before before you have mentioned that we need more teachers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not everyone i'm just saying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'due to future teacher do they need to write a business plan'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah we need more teachers'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah when it teaches to teach that but at the same time not all teachers are going to teach that that can be a special course to enlightened student more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's gonna be a cost that you every student is compulsory for every student to attend this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so so some more practical and business oriented plans for some students and i guess more theoretical fathers that's that's the idea'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but but no the the idea is that every student attends the class every student has an idea not every student is going to excel in business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some are just gonna be a plain office work some are just gonna be freelancers someone just gonna be whatever they wanna be right but at least everybody will we some people will know that ohh i think my desire is to business pay from there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so from that they'll start thinking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well but but but following the same logic you can say like not everybody will become a theoretical mathematician but shouldn't everyone try to become'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or at least have have some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not everybody 's gonna be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes but should they should they try'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you gonna have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well yeah you can try but you have an idea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if that's what they if that's what they want yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even though the war is the war is peak everybody has an opportunity there's different opportunities do you try to see the one you can take'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you apply for an opportunity if it works for you fine if it doesn't work you move on there's a another opportunity out there but if you're not used to this kind of a lifestyle where you know that though they are different opportunity if you just know always engineering and just try searching engineering and you feeling engineering then you believe that's oh there's no way for me to go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'william'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then the student doesn't go to school again becomes a joke he just feels like everything is not working out he's not excelling what he has practice because it doesn't have an idea that he can actually excel in other parts'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when a student is made to believe that he can do anything even if it wants to fly right now he can jump myself fly students who brain who is gonna open and they will to explore more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and it all comes back to the teacher'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but it was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly if the students thinking is streamlight'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not it then you have nothing to be back if it fails once it doesn't stand up again because it feels like the failure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is everything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i guess on on this optimistic note we can we can finish this conversation because it's kind of it's time but thank you yeah but thank you very much for coming here and we will have more conversation later please return it would be great thank you so much bye guys take care'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
