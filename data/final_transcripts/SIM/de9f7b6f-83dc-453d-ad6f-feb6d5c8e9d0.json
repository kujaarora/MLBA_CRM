        "'speaker_3': 'a matter of you know protecting me then OK i i i'd be OK with that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right and absolutely because like if so if an employer sees that you're a fan of the office and they hate the office they may you know deny that's a super simple example but they may deny you employment just because of that and that's just that's bogus you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well no that's that's the limits no like not anything that has to do like if it's not something that has to do with the business please don't base your judgement of your future employee possibilities on that no i can get that no no that's like i said there's a difference in personal and business lives like social and business lives'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're not always shooting down people and or you know putting down and stuff ohh that's would be a good worker'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know not based on what they're posting about but like just in general'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'now here's a question does your perception shift if the actual job you're going for has a public face versus you're like behind the scenes in the backroom somewhere where no one 's gonna see you kind of thing like if you're out and about representing that company you know face to face does that make a difference'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and that's kind of where i was kind of getting at in the beginning i feel like if a job has a persona to uphold and your persona doesn't necessarily mesh with what they're trying to present i think that's something that an employer should know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that that's the case that's business based a little more than just like it's not saying who they are like as a person like socially like ohh i love this thing it's not something like that so if it's like who they are as a person though that could be you know judged a little bit within reason'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but there's just limits to what they should judge your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know but overall it's just whether it's you know whether it should be seen you know they should be allowed to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because i mean people could try to make the argument ohh well you know i'm just gonna go on to this person 's profile outside of my business account'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i'm gonna go on to it in my own uh private facebook account and still look at them and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know because they could try to just say that and then find out that the person was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know so i would hope people wouldn't make that you know mistake but you know it's like there's so many ways to just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's also hard because people are just people and we have biases that we don't even realize that we have so it's just one of those things that it's it's i mean i guess i can't say one way or another that i'm forward or against it because i know there's people who would automatically have a certain opinion about a certain kind of person just off of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how how they were raised or just different things like that so i just feel like people being people we have that flaw and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'should we just completely mix it and it act like it doesn't exist or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have that there to check up on people to see if they are who they say they are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'one sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say compromise i guess would be the right word that i could see maybe if you know you're hired based upon your merit and your professional image et cetera and if there's ever any issues that come up like you're confrontational or you're you know belligerent or something like that in the workplace then maybe under some sort of like an investigation into that maybe the social media could come into play'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right that's that's with once you're employee like once you're an employee you know like that's that's a different you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'take this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'after that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to little bit of a different but i can i can get that yes so you know so basically'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you don't think we uh they should be looked at until'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like at least after hiring'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say so yeah like if it becomes an issue'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right because that's that can be i mean i've i can understand that because then ohh you didn't base hiring on that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i agree with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you may what's that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree with that like situation should occur before'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or uh before you know start digging into something social media'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right and i know a lot of companies have a social nowadays a lot of companies have a a policy in place that lets you know what kind of boundaries not the step over on social media'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right now that is understandable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know like in a sense like within reasons and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was also thinking like you know especially for a lot of big companies people just need a job so if they're if social media is a way for them to vent'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is what it is because a lot of these big employers and stuff they don't really care about the employee anyway so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it says you know you never know how one hire one employer compared to the next is gonna treat that like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if it's you know about the business overall'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sometimes people that work at the business are working it because they can not because they want'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know i mean we would hate to say that but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just real'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there are some things that i can do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's kind of like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's kind of like someone who smokes pot you know like i'm a small business owner with my other half and if anyone we hire like we don't care if you smoke pot just don't do it on company hours you can do whatever you want you don't not during company hours but just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and do it right'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's a good question'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm OK with it honestly cause it's it's their own personal time as long as not like ohh i'm at work smoking up you know like that would that would obviously'",
