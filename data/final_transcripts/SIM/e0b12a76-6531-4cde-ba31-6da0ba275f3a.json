        "'speaker_4': 'uh shi believe that smoggy should be made illegal in public places because it's it's actually very injurious to health so the people who actually do not have the orient who do not smoke should not be exposed to it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i disagree i think that it's a public place and i believe that people should be free to you know for example here in the UK united kingdom we've had a ban in well it majority inside places for the last i think it's about thirteen years or fifteen years'",

        "'speaker_2': 'stop that in in hospital grounds and train stations and so forth which i i disagree with because it is outside and i think as as long as it's outside in a public area i think people should be allowed to you know to take take part in whatever you know for a lot of people it's it's the class as a a hobby don't they or an interest so you know i think it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'demon do you see the point'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i agree i i agree with what sienna is saying because like you know kind of like i believe in personal freedoms and especially if it's outside you're really not harming anyone but even if say like a restaurant chooses to have smoking indoors like if you're you don't want to expose yourself to smoking you could go to a different restaurant that doesn't allow smoking indoors so i just think that it should be you know a matter of personal choice and sort of let'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on the economy sorted out you know if if people stop going to restaurants because people are allowed to smoke their then you know obviously the restaurants will change their minds and i think you know even like if you're exposed in a government building or something that you have to go to that's pretty like probably a short amount of time and probably not in every area of the building so i think it's OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so you guys don't believe in taking hand the the sort of the best of smoking any harm in passive smoking'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right i get it see i you both of your points N and they they're they like you are right to their own places because the thing is everybody has their own choices they have their privacy and you know they can they can do whatever they want i mean it's a public place obviously but it's not the concept of passive smoking if you would know is for the person who doesn't want to smoke what about them and if a lady if she's pregnant what about her and if they're exposed to smoke and what about the children who are exposed to smoke'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is uh we really don't you know it it it's actually really harmful to the health i mean i'm not saying that stop smoking at all i mean like it's everyone's choice but just not doing it in public places because it yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're should they do instead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that you'll it was starting to have an impact then on the economy wouldn't it you know people just wouldn't go out you know like yeah yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'second do you see this point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i don't think that smoking is that important to anyone that there is stop going outside because we have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you'll be surprised'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh is that so because i don't see it i don't really see a point here because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you're not a smoker'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i'm not i'm not i i'm definitely not but it's fine it's everyone's choice i mean but if in public places like if there are children or maybe if they are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'gets in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if they are older people like you know other people who are like more than forty more than fifty who who do who should not be exposed to these kinds of smokes this cigarette smoke'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",

        "'speaker_4': 'there is a difference i mean there's a difference see here the the thing is the gases the gases released via these the combustion engines and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's the difference no one wants to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and as compared to for cigarettes they are different for cigarettes it's purely tar the tar is more harmful than these kinds of cases'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but DOD is going inside that person who is smoking it not the other person who was passively smoking it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the the point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like how how harmful is it i guess to be exposed for say like a few minutes or a minute or two of second hand smoke while walking through the lobby and that's just like a legitimate question like i don't even i don't even really know but i would assume like that that's like pretty minimal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's pretty harmful it's pretty harmful especially in south asia it's actually i'm sure you're aware of it the smoke and all all all sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes i am'",
        "'speaker_1': 'estima is is a major concern in that part of the world'",

        "'speaker_4': 'it is a really big concern yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'diana that the thing is it doesn't that doesn't happen in south asia that's the point i mean the people actually talking about the the smokers are respectful it it must have been happening in other countries but specifically in india it doesn't it doesn't work like that especially in countries like in south'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tasia'",

        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is not like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah it should be it should be because my passes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'smoking is as harmful as you know smoking directly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah it is it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it is it is because you are actually consuming that smoke when it goes to your lungs so it's going to do the same damage as you you know have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no it's it's not not not the same'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because the amount matters i think like probably somebody who smokes like a pack of day is getting way more than like somebody who's just like taking a whiff you know or you know even a little bit everyday is still less i'm not i don't know how more or less harmful it is but like i think you're getting less if you're second hand presumably'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'this is the thing is yeah yeah yeah please click on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh not necessarily because you don't have those harmful chemicals and tar so it it's it's a it's a lesser of an evil let's put it that way'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_1': 'it it depends on your tolerance so if someone who was a non smoker if yeah if if if you give them a certain amount of nicotine it's actually do you see the point of infringement of personal rights if if government starts to ban these things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it gives the buzz it it's about the buzz it gives'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whole point of you know not allowing it in the public places i mean you can be we obviously cannot just go on you know stopping stop someone doing something because they want to do it and say it's their choice it's a human right i mean they can do anything they want but it's just because of the health hazards and you know the environmental hazard it has not even the environmental it's actually for the human hazard the health hazard what it has'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so that's the point that that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think to be i i think to be honest the the moment we step out of our front doors and we go to work or we see friends we're taking a risk when we cross the road when we drive a car so i think you could start to look at it well you know if we if we regarded everything the same as smoking then we'd be sort of living in a nanny state you know we look at the coming out of covid now on the pandemic and all the restrictions that were imposed on us you know i think it would be another i think it would just cause another upheaval'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but where where do you stand on on on this enforcement by the government when people are not smart enough to voluntarily do those things or in third world countries where where the society hasn't evolved enough to understand those things that they are harming other peoples do do you see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be quite honest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah right'",

        "'speaker_3': 'but the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the government could like get it like like if there is like the part of the problem is that the people just aren't like super knowledgeable about the facts of you know smoking and others or whatever the government could just engage in a like a campaign you know like where they on the TV or the radio or a sign like to let people know so they could do it like that way like as opposed to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at the cost of losing the funding from tobacco companies'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't think there's a practical solution come on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i will say that in the united states like what you do in a public place outside like it's kind of very much protected by the government in some ways like cause like if you wanna have a protest or something they'll absolutely shut down the streets of chicago to in like the middle of the day to traffic to like allow people to exercise their freedom of like speech and right to protest and stuff so like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the thing is'",

        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from my perspective here like i feel like to say like like you cannot do something especially like outdoors in a public area is like it's pretty like it i feel like it's a big deal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of of of banning it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like like like banning it would be like a really big deal because then what are like kind of what we were talking about before like what are you gonna ban next you know like are you gonna say like well maybe you can't gather'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fast foods and sweets and yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cola soft drinks all sorts of things'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think in in new york there are actually like they tried to i don't know if they were successful or not but they tried to like put in a big extra tax on the soda so that like the city would get a like for every soda sold a lot of money and so it would be like to discourage the drinking of the soda but i don't know if the lie actually passed or not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah i'm i'm sure there are plenty of things that could be banned but but i think it it dials back to how much the government should be dictating us as a society and are we smart enough as a society to sort of police each other or just be courteous and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think i think there would be riots i think people would start to rebel on and you'll you'll get like a division of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know sort of if people perform people against and i think it just causes like civil unrest for some people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the yeah you're right you're right anna it it it it can happen but in specifically if i talk about india it's actually i mean smoking in public places is actually banned i mean like places like it's in public parks or maybe you know in shopping malls or maybe if it's just like any example of public places it is banned i mean people still people do it but it is actually banned by the government so even if they have you know have put any kind of a ban they still do it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but at an extent people on take it on themselves and they you know tell to the person who's actually doing it in the public place this they tell him by themselves that the app please don't do it or maybe if there is a child or maybe something like that so that does happen but the scenario if you are discussing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so what what are the what are the repercussions or what are the punishments for people that you know still decide to smoking in india in public places'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's uh mere it it's a mere rupees fine i mean it would be around in dollars for in in pounds it would be around five pounds five sterling and it in indian rupees it's it's nothing it's equal to nothing i mean if they don't even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's nothing is it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are you gonna bribe the police officer with a couple of pounds and saves three'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah it's it's it it it it happened in south asia it happens a lot but but the thing is if we like i know it it has two sides i mean if you go for the banning part because tobacco industry is actually very is quite a big industry and every country the tieback specifically the tobacco industry and india it is it is really a very big industry because apart from cigarettes there are a lot of other things there are things called kamala there are things called gutka so these are the local'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's funny'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know things they make these companies make and they thrive on it it's really it's it's in it's in what do you call it's a billion dollars if you see in india specifically so it's really big industry but coming to the point where we actually have to ban it from the public places it in my i have a strong opinion that it should be done because it is hazardous after all that is why'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think the only the only thing that bugs me is the you know the the the waste product that is obviously you know the cigarette butts that are left at the end that is a personal bugbear of mine and i think even if like bins are provided or like special or stubbing out areas you know for smokers not everybody respects that and obviously then that contributes to litter'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they it's just all over the sidewalk'",

        "'speaker_4': 'true that true that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's the only thing i will say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so what's the solution guys so should we have some public sort of designated areas where where people would smoke or they should just smoke inside and if there is like a blanket ban on cigarettes don't you think it will sort of manifest into something even worse like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cool'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this banning them right right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think you need some designated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'having a black market like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't think just banning them won't be a solution'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think you need designated areas you know i don't think a complete band would ever work because people would just do what they like still anyway you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so outside of workplaces here there's like a lot of designated areas like no longer can you really smoke at work but they kind of have a spot kind of away from the entrance where you can smoke outside and like when i was younger people would smoke they smoke close to the entrance they'd smoke it's sometimes in their offices and nobody thought anything of it but since they moved them out move people outside like it's kind of become like looked upon pretty unfavorably'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i'm kind of you know more in favor of like preserving your personal rights and not letting the government intervene but i feel like maybe like my point of view has been impacted a lot just by like covid and being forced to like i guess not forced but like kind of strongly recommended to say and stay inside by the government and stuff so like you can realize like how difficult things can be if the government is deciding your life for you so ever since then i've kind of been'",
