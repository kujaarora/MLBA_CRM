        "'speaker_1': 'great excellent so like i said we're going to have a healthy debate and really want to hear what you guys have to say so don't be afraid to interject when necessary so the topic of the debate today is playing sport as a child and as important as getting an education for personal development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so doreen if you want to start what do you think about that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i did make a few assumptions that you mean organized sports'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't think i don't think organized sports is necessary because there are some people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but they just are not good at it good at it and there are other ways to be competitive i also get concerned with the self esteem of people that aren't good that are forced to be in it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that's a good good point irene'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some children just aren't cut out for sports overall i do think it is important that children have an alternative outlet to formal education which obviously can include sports for many children but but i also think there are many other outlets which they will find just as interesting and will help their development in the long term'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know one of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh i think maybe we should let casino'",
        "'speaker_2': 'credit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but let's go first so please'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i kind of think that sports is really valuable for kids and it does allow them to have sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the outside time apart from this academic learning that is common and there's different types of sports so they can choose from different things to do doesn't mean one sort of sport is like they have to do if they don't like it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know there's a lot of variation and it's good for stuff like discipline'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and resilience and just building on yeah just having those steps that build to personal development more than just sitting in a classroom'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and that was one point that i wanted to make i in the US physical education classes are a requirement because i do think physical activity is key so i would sort of assuming that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sports again was the organized and the they would still get physical activities through their gym classes and that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes the there is obviously we need to differentiate between organised activities and less formal after school activities for example many children will develop a very quickly in their sporting or other interest outside of school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i don't think it's something that can be legislated for but i do think the opportunity is important and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'four sport to be important for the children that believe it should be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and why do you think that i shouldn't be legislated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we then get done back to to compulsion and as we all know the well we've all been through the school process for myself it was a long time ago but there are some children who are just not cut out for team sports for example or some children who get very very miserable very withdrawn and are never going to be team sports players yet if we have the time to talk to that child'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and discover what their interests are then hopefully we can direct them to something that will be much more useful to them in the long run than my grandson for example he is quite sporting but he's not very academic yet if you put them into the great outdoors so be that camping or hiking or any activity like that he he he blossoms'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and he will develop and have a career in outdoor activities in the future because that's what interests in rather than academia or a team sporting activity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there are some advantages or some uhm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'some important points that uh sports grow the mental health of a child let's say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that maybe education can't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes i would agree with that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would i would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would say that and i think i'm more influenced by the amount of bullying that's going on in schools is why it wouldn't make it mandatory'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i do think that if a child as a parent you should try to direct your child to be in involved in sports i would make mine try if they expressed an interest and if they said ohh i don't like it i said will you commit it you have to continue so they learn those lessons but if they told me i absolutely hate this it would be OK we'll go back to something different'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK yeah casina if you wanna go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i think to do with mental health it really helps because you release things like endorphins which release stress and like pain so it's good in that way and i think in terms of fitness as a whole for everyone that should be something to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'regardless if you like love it or wanna make it your career or just have it on the side and i do think there is variation in sports that you can choose from and you can find what kind of works for you or your child'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and that can kind of help in there development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because like for me growing up and going to school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i did a lot of sports and i think it did help with stuff like teamwork leadership and just kind of building on a skill and you kind of see the results getting better every time that you do the sport or you train'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so and and sometimes you don't always see that in other forms of in maybe like academics it's it's it's a different skill set that's used'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and i think i think both are important but definitely having sports is key'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'certainly activities are very important for mental health at any age and i don't think that just applies to to children and but certainly children will develop as very well rounded individuals if they have the opportunity and encouragement to participate in a range of activities not every child knows at a certain age what they're going to end up doing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so i i just think it's important that they have a range of opportunities during that developmental stage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think one of the i have a grandson that expressed an interest in baseball and he did it for several years but here in the US'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's become so competitive it's almost like you have to pick your sport by the time you're five years old you then specialize in that sport'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh wow'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and go to camps and learn how so if you're just a kid that comes along later in life and says i wanna do baseball you're not gonna make the tea'",
        "'speaker_2': 'team because you haven't had the training and background and that's where i get frustrated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah understandably yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah are there any sort of social like uh social sports where it's not as competitive as that a thing or not at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's what's hard is other than you know sort of the after school kids in the neighborhood getting together which doesn't happen a whole lot with video games but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most teams over here are extremely competitive and it would be it would be nice if there was some almost like levels of you know you're in when you get to professional sports you have like level A B C'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but over here it's pretty much limited to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the organ donation that's sponsors it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i see i see'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah in sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please go ahead casino'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say in the UK it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doesn't need supports bring out competitiveness in people and it is competitive mostly but i do think there's also space for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you to just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want to do at any stage in enjoy it i think there is that freedom so maybe there's also that difference there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh that council certain beliefs or certain like attitudes towards if it's really necessary for personal development and like different barriers and stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i also find i think this is probably worldwide that if a sport is very organized then with the drive towards children as doreen said children having to make her mind up when there's young as five years old it is that drive coming from the child or is that drive coming from the parents sometimes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you know we we've all seen situations where the parent on the sideline is getting more involved in the childish sometimes and i don't feel that's necessarily a good thing because the child might be doing it for the benefit of the parents rather than for their own benefits and i don't know if you agree with that or not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would say that's very true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well let's go let's the ring go first'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was just going to say i i do think that's very true'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in a lot of cases but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i took a scene 's point i think that the advantages of like the endorphins being released and that are important it's just whether or not it has to be through sports or running on the treadmill or whatever'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the i guess david 's point i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think at certain age'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the child'",
        "'speaker_4': 'faith agree with disagree but the child is not gonna'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have free choice to decide what they want like they are going to have to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and work in the bounds of the parents or maybe even the school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so in terms of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like having that choice is still bounded'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so i think i think there's a balance like of course parents will push their child to do a sport and they might like it they might not i do agree that you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if if they're trying to do it just for parent approval and it's not there passion as much as the parents that can be kind of toxic as well but there is a part of it where it's like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is a choice that a choice that you've given but you don't really get the full range to choose as a as a kid so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so basically U M sports has some psychological benefits for children and adolescents and teaches them some important life skills but the competitiveness of parents mostly comes a bit in the way of that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in in some cases i think it it does but in other cases'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know the child might be lost without that parental guidance it it it's very difficult to give a one size fits all answer because children are so different in their needs and their rates of development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it depends yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'certainly if someone choose a very strong skill at one particular sport then by all means i need that in encouragement there's been all know as a child develops and even as adults develop you know your interest can change'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and as as you learn life experiences'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do think too that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'than being competitive is a skill that they have to learn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because that's just life'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now and and i'm a little curious i think you know i tell myself well you could learn to be competitive through'",
        "'speaker_2': 'board games or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh debating that sort of thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i do think that there is an advantage to that athletic competition'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i again i just don't think you can force that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know i said i do think that it comes down to a matter of choice and if a child is shows a naturally high level of intelligence or is very good at languages or or very good that physics or art or one of the other educational subjects then then perhaps they should be pushed a little more in that direction rather than having to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and do several hours of set sports every way and it's recognizing with different particular skills each child has and and trying to fit them into a an educational establishment which sometimes it's set very much in its way and doesn't allow for individual interests and development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'another thought'",
        "'speaker_1': 'please drain go ahead first'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was just going to say another'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would go with my question after'",
        "'speaker_2': 'another thought that came to my mind on the parenting side is what's equally frustrating are parents that don't promote good physical activity for their children'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i think it's sad when if you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you have somebody that doesn't promote that as a parent and you just all turn around laying around being lazy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i agree actually'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now the grey entirely yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry could say that didn't mean to interrupt you though'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i i do think i think there's a part of ourselves as humans to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do things that would kind of help our bodies in terms of function and and fitness and sports does help through that so if you didn't have someone pushing you that way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes like kind of you're not allowing maybe a part of who you are or you as a person to explore that which which is kind of limiting as well so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stop'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i wonder in this age of taking steroids in that sort of thing too at what point maybe sports can start to mess with your head'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just comparing your muscular build or whatever to other people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i suppose yeah body image'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for young people can be very important but also with taking the the wrong way can be very destructive as well i feel and and and this can link it with with sports and all the activities'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but certainly when you look at problems like anorexia and believe mia and that is often a negative body image when other people would toast totally disagree so can sport for example be useful in deflecting people from their body image rather than having to build up muscles mass for example can it just be a simple child's game being played in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the playground that is going to help them develop the child rather than an a truly organised team sport'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so basically what we have come to the conclusion is that sports has some or can have some psychological benefits for children and adolescents and can teach them also some important life skills now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'does education do it in the same regard or what are the benefits to education and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well being in the country where we're starting to feel like we're the dumbest country in the world because there's not enough emphasis on education i would say that it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i view it as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'really important to david 's point there are some kids that struggle with that and i but i think we owe it to them to help them to develop in that area'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah a structured education you know is essential but at the end of the day it's all it comes down to the individual 's how much benefit they they get from it and we can apply that to structured education we can apply that to sport we can apply that to many things in life'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's a pointless made a few minutes ago'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and some sometimes though it's not just what the child would like to do it's how much support comes from home as well of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and that's once again can be applied to sport or to education if a child receives the right sort of encouragement and and they have the ability they can do well in many aspects of life sporting or educational or career'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think in terms of is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'formal education can teach you the same sort of things as if you were doing a sport'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i don't think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's always so similar because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when you do sports obviously more practical you're applying everything that you've learned and in i guess formal education'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the i guess the system different systems all around the world but it's a lot of it's not always practical'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you don't always get to apply what you've learned in that situation then so you don't always see the you don't always see your progress and even the way progress is measured'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it can sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'negatively affect your self esteem with the with grading and and things like that like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i do i just think it's it is different and it may try to uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know have the same sort of benefits and things but there there are quite big differences'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the other point that i was thinking i found as an ogre adult that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was one of these people that got all a 's in school'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK nice'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i was good at i was good at learning it to get the grade and as i look back in life there's a lot of stuff that i basically memorized it for the test and so i don't know it now so i think that's something that i wish they would do with education to is really work with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kids to teach them don't just memorize things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and i do agree casina that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i can't remember the last time i used algebra or chemistry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'however if you've got me a class in balancing my checkbook or managing my finances that would be very very key'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh that's that's sort of brings back some painful memories'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'masters was one of my strong subjects but algebra i still cannot see the benefits of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i'm being quite negative when i say that but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so we can we can say so what what part or what contribution does education give a child in personal development'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can you repeat that sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what contribution does education give a child in his personal development'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it teaches'",
        "'speaker_1': 'pleased to ring your head'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it teaches them that discipline that you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'responsibilities that you need to achieve'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my grandson just the other day didn't turn in a bunch of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'homework and he said oh i don't need to do that i'm never gonna speak spanish and i'm like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if that's not the point your teacher tells you to do something you need to do it because that's what's gonna happen when you get in the business world'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes it it it it is important because it it does'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't know necessarily if i'd agree with the word disciplines being the best description but it certainly gives you a structure of of learning and a structure of developing your life and developing your your career and and yes i suppose discipline is the best way of describing it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yo but at the end of the day some children will deliver develop very well ever well they do i was a child who didn't spend a lot of time listening to teachers but i was relatively lucky and that when information went into my brain that tended to stay there so i could pass exams without too much work and i i take no pride when i say that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that is just the way i am i then went on to have her successful career as a a veterinary surgeon and i've recently retired but i i was lucky there are a lot of children who need structure and and need discipline and need formal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'huh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'direction in their education and in their sporting activities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and we're all different and it's i don't think a one size fits all suits all children i'd say develop but it is also very difficult to take into account all the individual needs of every individual child'",
