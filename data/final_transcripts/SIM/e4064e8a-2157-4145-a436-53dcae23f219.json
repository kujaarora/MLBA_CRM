        "'speaker_3': 'well i don't i mean i don't either but i also look at other clothes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean but that that's thing so if you look at one if you got one more than four clothes you're gonna see normal people as salespeople'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's the high dollar retailers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's it's the the high dollar designers that don't design clothes that are are made to look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as good on a larger size or on somebody that's is that's not conventionally attractive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and if we really honestly if we want to change that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if if we want to go more towards the the moral and ethical side of things money talks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it's it's not my money that's gonna talk because i'm not shopping it's little places i can't afford to you know so it's those the people that have the money that can shop at these high dollar retailers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's where they put their money if they say to these people we need to see more variety we need to see more regular looking people'",

        "'speaker_1': 'ohh what was it one of the american eagle air apostle one of those type of places and the judge ruled that it was legal because there wasn't anything it wasn't a race thing it wasn't a sexual thing it wasn't a gender thing it wasn't any of those'",

        "'speaker_1': 'and what's even an age discrimination thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they could not prove'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the reason they weren't being hired was because of their looks'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so TIA do you want to jump in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean this summer and slow'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes we cannot always commercialize things for everything as such allen said it's right we have to choose people with their looks at times but not everywhere i would say'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but not everywhere when you are look when you have clothings of all sizes you must have models of all sizes and there there has to be equality when you are advertising and that's what i would like to say and i don't say that you see people with everyone are pretty that's what i would say i need i i'm saying that we have to change it we have once when we start when that is the the first person will always face some difficulty in changing something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if we keep when we set an example gradually there will be people who would like us and gradually it would be a plus point for us so that everyone will change their ideas that's what i would like to say'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but again money talk'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i agree that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you're right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that should that should be another place that they should not focus on the ultra skinny super tall and even super white like because models are one thing but the general populace is a different thing and you send that money talks but not everyone looks like a model'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and everyone is able to pull off what model where'",

        "'speaker_3': 'usually they end up underweight'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't alexic and most of them have to like resolve to drugs and even to lose more weight because we heard of carly claus heard of bella hadid with her of of her that she does heroin and coke and whatnot so like they're literally these are naturally skinny people having to work even harder to fit the size zero size of like two clothing or like double zeros because i remember when i was younger double zeros triple zero'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'holding and that's not not not only is it not ideal it's not feasible for the majority of the people including the models'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",

        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you're starting to make people think that the only way you can wear those clothes the clothes is to be that size because you see a clothes'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes i would like to say that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see people as maria said people are focusing on middle class and higher middle class and rich people and that that puts the pressure on the remaining people who who are always looking at the advertisements and things like that that that that brings upon a pressure on those people and they feel that pressure at times when there are people above certain age they would not have that pressure they they just go away like that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the teens and the small children and all you know they would always have that pressure when they see their peers having something branded and things like that so i think the recruiters must always think about everyone like the poor people the middle class and the upper middle class and the rich everyone must have must be treated equal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i feel like not only does interstate that money talks but it's also like sort of like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i was internalized like discrimination where like you yourself aren't skinny but you would not you would rather focus or you'd rather have a focus on someone that is skinnier because that is your goal that is what you want to look like even though it's not how you look like and then those people that work there even though you said that money talks'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it does'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like for example it was i think what's nothing is like the whole thing was back then was nothing is as sweet as skinny feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then now we're all about it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they can taste good as skinny feels yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and then now it's more like ohh embrace natural body and then there's a little like subject and BBL 's and whatnot and perhaps the surgery and i see that we're showing showing summit sorry swinging back to the whole like skinny idealization not as much as before but i'm seeing it now again and it's not always like the people that are buying or not but you may have a lot of poor people buying but if one person that's rich and has a lot of money buys it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then that's gonna be disproportionate'",
