        "'speaker_1': 'but but but yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think the point he's making is that like you say young people now if you look at young people now that they've all got false eyelashes on they've all got and i mean you know the the really really even though they're beautiful they think they still want it they still want to add on to that he shouldn't believable isn't it spend fortunes on themselves'",
        "'speaker_4': 'wasn't that inferences'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'moral'",

        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's i mean someone said earlier about the fact that you know can we make it illegal you know to to sell people people employers to discriminate between good what what they think is a good looking person and what's an unattractive person but there's no way you could make it's nowhere that law could be enforced'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's right yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no i i agree i agree otherwise it will there will be ways to circumvent that somehow i mean that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean i i mean i mean how are you going to do that right i mean if you if you said OK we're gonna determine attractiveness by let's say a certain parameters like you have a genetic facial mask and you and you compare faces and see how well the faces fit in or any other body measurements i mean that's i mean if they did that as a law that would create even more discrepancy because now you're discriminating people for real'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like saying OK if if if you don't meet these criterias are not beautiful so so there's really no way to enforce this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no no unfortunately there was you know like you said they can it's i mean because they they always say as well that you know beauty is in the eye of the beholder what you think what you think is a beautiful person might not necessarily mean the same to somebody else'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i think i think i didn't today'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at the end of the day it should be made known to everybody the difference between discrimination and employing certain people for these certain particular job because when people understand the difference between discrimination i straight up discrimination and people that are actually qualify for a certain level of job i think we will have more peace now in our society because when someone is employed even model that looks attractive than the other model is employed for a job they will say they are discriminating against me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because it looks more attractive and that's not discrimination it is what the employer wants for the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah maybe maybe there's one interesting argument as well which my my father-in-law brought up recently and i'm an economist by heart i grew i mean i'm yeah i'm an economist but he said something which made me really which made me really think he said why not what what if we would pay everyone the same equal pay'",

        "'speaker_3': 'one would get the same salary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well regardless then we would have less problems i think and then something i at first i you know i i argued against too heavily and said well never have done my career without you know the the the the the the money aspect involved but the more i think about it the more i thought it through the more i think that is a very very interesting position'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's an interesting theory but then the day i don't think that could work because at the end of the day you know it's all about it's about your education as well i mean then you know when it's again again it's about being fair if you've gone through your if you've gone through your schooling and you've really buckled down and you've done well at school and got their qualifications that you you know all the qualifications against someone that sits there twiddling the thumbs all there and not doing anything why should they get the same pay as you'",

        "'speaker_2': 'do much education at all because that's just what they're like like if if people as a whole looked at it that way i think it could work but i think it's just not realistic right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no it isn't realistic no i mean it's in the day if you're if you're a CEO in the company and you're the one that's making the ultimate decisions then it's your head and it's your head that rolls if things don't go right you know you you i think you need you're entitled to be rewarded for that for that responsibility'",
