        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like like like you know proactively he will or she will be doing that type of post to impress his employer so this this kind of thing won't even matter because a person who is a shrewd kind of person can you know misuse this yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i but uh like see the uh technology is changing and we're actually i must say technology is changing there are different platforms these days wherein the clients are coming up with like a record video series google like it's done through google chrome you can you need to record because if you're applying for a position now you need to record your CV'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's fine see i'm not talking about that thing i'm talking about social media like facebook giving up a video like giving a video is fine but going through the profile and to go through the someones personal information is hazardous is not good it's like you know going to sam's privacy if you are the HR and if you are not for if you are not fit for your role like you have to go to someone else'",

        "'speaker_1': 'that that's i'm sorry to uh i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry to interrupt that because i'm i'm really sorry to interrupt that the reason is because when the person the when the candidate he or she is applying for the post the client is actually putting up a question to share his horror linkedin or facebook ID OK if he or she is not interested then only then then they will not provide that ID that means that candidate is not interested in sharing his or her personal details like facebook or linkedin but when the clients requirement is so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we let it would be necessary that he or she shares that particular linkedin because it is so it is accepted by the candidate OK it is accepted by the candidate that you can go ahead and check my profile so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'having having said that having said that i let me share you some very odd incident which which happened with one of my friend 's friends'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there were two people men and female they were engaged and the male candidate asked for the personal facebook ID from the girl and she declined so he gave the same kind of example just because i have given my facebook profile to my employer it the same way i must know your past which you may be hiding so this is actually you know going to to someone 's privacy if you wanna say no to the marriage'",

        "'speaker_3': 'to going to suffice privacy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually what what's the point if you if if your life is very clear open and clear there's no issues in sharing your personal need is because i don't think that is going to affect anybody 's job or life because if you if you're hiding something then it's very you will not give if you're not hiding i'm really open to give it'",

        "'speaker_3': 'no so so so so so so having said that'",

        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those are when it comes when it comes for an interview the truth everything will be clear because he he will be present we he won once he'll have to actually go for a face to face at that time every truth will come forward so what's the point like now you give the linkedin linkedin ID or facebook ID he if he's chosen for the process then he will be called for a face to face there everything everything will be open OK there is no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well well that is my my my point explain since when when you're buying a product online let's say and you're you're looking at reviews together to better grasp or to better gauge what you're actually buying into and the reviews can still be fake but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the but there's a chance that you will have a better feel and once you get the product you can you you can you can always see if it meets your standard or not and if not then most retailers allow you to send it back and get your money back so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so my point here is why shouldn't that apply to a candidates as well for jobs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly because i'll see we go on review some of our products so why because we want to have the best best best thing that we purchase so the same way the candidate clients are also moving into the they're changing their perspective because what it is actually saving the time because the organizations are not taking the headache of recruiting they're giving the job for recruitment company they are giving and the recruitment companies are giving actually to a certain jobs to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'different agencies to collect the informations OK brad now if you if you do if you have joined for an MNC the background check is not done by the organization itself it is given to an agency so what so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and agency and agency is doing what just sampling going through the profile that's it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no he actually visits he he visit or the agency calls and finds out before you join because are you this particular person are you actually living in this address this is a procedure that that is called background verification'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see see alfred you are missing the point see it's been it's it's been ten years i haven't posted anything on my facebook because facebook is gone now and i think instagram is tracking over so the point is any person who is actually seeing the future can post according to his future selection like i i would be going to some good giant company like microsoft or google so i should be actually making my arrangements from now so actually when after one year two year when my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'temporary gonna see my profile he will be impressed so for the point of all these things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that's why people are likely to actually taking candidates on linkedin linkedin is actually as has a standard OK it has been it linkedin has a standard and it has been operated by every'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no you you are now you are now actually going to the you are going to the link linkedin but stay stay with the facebook stay with the facebook because facebook is this social media so we are actually that that that that topic is the social media not the linkedin'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see we are we are not it is that is no it is not only linkedin or facebook'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it every everything is everything is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'linkedin is also like a social media itself because it's also a social platform wherein you can hire candidates through'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but the but the topic is actually not about the linkedin because linkedin is mainly for the professionals if if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course when you can take a candidate it has taken from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a reliable source where you find the right candidate and linkedin is there actually a backbone right these days where you find the right candidate like every day if i have been working i have been working with linkedin i don't go for facebook because i know like facebook can come up with fake IDS i have experienced it OK it's not that i'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you can make fake IDS but you can make fake IDS on linkedin as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you have to go in front of them right if you get if you get selected'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if you get selected don't you have to go for a face to face there you are what do you have here in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so if the point is going to the face to face then what's the use of linkedin or the facebook on the on the very first place if if the if the point is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the social media platform'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes it we don't require it in the first place'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we don't require these platforms for our employee our employers to select us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to make decisions that we qualify to be a part of their company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that that's really that is a work of workplace do use social medias OK to be very honest workplace like HR these days they are not going and visiting in a candidate or otherwise they will call for a walk in interviews OK walk in interviews is like visiting the place provide providing them their CVS and other relevant documents that is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'face to face finished'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean there there will a joke which was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but they can have virtual interviews like we we are currently having on MS teams or on google meet and stuff like that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'even when you before going for virtual'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they don't need social media for that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'before you go for a virtual meeting or you are being asked to provide these things only because for them to know are we selecting the right candidate OK so could you please share your that is linkedin ID'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all these things because every because i can give you with solid proof like or what the HR these days send out a an email to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that that is they actually find people from linkedin source and then they contact that particular send a small if you are interested in this particular position which is open right now we are hiring candidates so if you are interested please please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but resumes and CV 's can also do the same thing i mean i don't think so they are they should be allowed to look at uh their future employees social medias i mean it can also create a lot of bias'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and CV and and resume is an old method which is actually used by whole masses but linkedin you can say fifty percent chooses so so if you actually stress with the linkedin so fifty percent of the good candidates can be out of the list but if you stick with the CV and there's anything then hold hundred percent gonna come in the list which which might be fruitful to the company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'why'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when it comes to selecting employees'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but see aiden recruitment social media platforms can be used to publicize job openings source candidates and verify background information that you agree that because by the end of the day the HR or the recruiter needs to provide the right candidate that he's sending to that particular organization now if he's not doing his job then he is going to lose that contract with the client'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so that's the reason these HR because it is not it is also it is a clients need these these days these HR 's are following the client would actually give them a particular agenda that they have to follow it is not the recruitment companies providing them like josh said like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do we when we purchase certain things we go actually we do use a look into the reviews even before downloading an app when we before downloading that app we look into the reviews to see how this app has been what what are the other people 's review on this particular app is it making your system lap lag'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i think most of these reviews are so fake i just believe most of these reviews are so fake because when you receive the final product it's most of the time that you would wanna return it because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'final product you said you said final product OK when do you come come to new it is final product'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah true true'",
        "'speaker_4': 'even receive it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and we make our yeah we make these decisions on these reviews and they are almost a fake most of the time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'receive it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'see being a being an employer if you give me two chances'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that is a that is a chance that is always a you can give it back if you are not satisfied correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'alfred alfred'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it wastes a lot of time i mean why should i do that i buy it and then i replace it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is why i'm telling you that is why you i'm telling you it is not a waste of time for these in in these days like when you send or buy something actually if you check it before receiving it like that like that is why because make a deep study and the recruitment people are doing the same these days'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but all these people that they write they it's not reliable that's what i'm saying that these information that they're putting out these accounts that there are hundreds of accounts and most of these are represented by just one person you know that one person can make so many different fake accounts that's what i'm saying that they can represent a very different people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'very true see alfred if you are given to two options on the option number one you have to write a very good climatical essay about yourself about your past work and secondly on the second thing you have to create a video of like three minutes telling about your past as an employer i would go for the video because in the script a person can lie and say i have a very good english but when because he or she can take take and help of anyone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but if the video if he is actually not having good fluency we can set up a say no this man is lying because in the video he is nervous he cannot do my work so you know like in the two options as an employer i've i would go for the video but not with the social media profile yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true true i agree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is why that is why i told you like that is what i told you these days HR 's are following the network there is called the there's an app called through google chrome that is called records video CVS which i every day you can do with with my peer that is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but alfred stick with the with your job with with your role like you should stick with the social media because if you are supporting the video thing it means you are supporting me or anshika but you have to support the social media profile like text content'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the role is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm talking about i see that is why i'm because we are actually looking into linkedin social media see linkedin is also issues with social media where you gather in what we call resumes of candidates OK like it is not only from one particular place it is from all over the world OK and facebook we don't go for facebook because we actually go it's not we are not finding the right candidate we did we did change'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but what is the difference between facebook and linkedin i don't feel there is much difference they both are social media one is used for majorly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well don't don't say that that you don't have any you know have you mean to say that facebook is different and linked both are the same that you're saying you mean to say linkedin and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes one is like major league people use for professional aspect and the other is majorly family and friends and connecting family and friends and the other is useful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that your linkedin you can find professionals so we go for professionals of course like so even in on facebook also we we go we have tried to find candidates on linkedin facebook but we haven't got'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'professionalism yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'basically you know what you're saying you're saying that because it's linked in so it's more reliable and it's more trustable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so there are so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that all lords of social platforms'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that interview'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so where would you go if you if you really want people where would you go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or the video'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that would you go actually see don't you see don't you think like you will actually go for the place where actually you get a response from a proper response or we do would you waste your time on a different platform i would go for i would go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm just thinking that social media is not the right place and employers should not make their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for the zoom meeting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the proper proper CVN SMA which like anshika and i am talking about like if you are again i'm i'm repeating myself if you go for linkedin i am pretty sure damn sure that not all the masses are using linkedin but with the orthodox or the conventional method is CV resume which is an old tradition which is still exists which does exist and if you go with that so you will be picking the good candidates because those who are actually only concentrating on their skills'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but not on linkedin you will find those through the CVS meeting but linkedin the chances are those who want to show off and those who could have like you know use the could english not with their mind but through some help external help you could also pick those people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'among your selection'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but i'm i'm in for but one by the end of the day if you're being selected you have to present yourself in front of them there you are actually cheating right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'angela'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so there's a there's a whole point if you are wasting your human resources to go through this thing and in the end of the day you are actually again filtering out so you are wasting your time energy and money for for your company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is why we call that we that is why we actually and that is why we actually look into the CFV then fix up a telephonic interview that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so if so if you are looking at the CV then what's the whole point of using the linkedin and facebook if you are actually flipping those pages to find the right candidate so why are you wasting your time with our facebook and linkedin thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we need to know what is this uh education qualification what is this what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah so that so that could be done using the CV and assume'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the resume or CV board are the same OK so let me tell you what what is the difference actually like see first thing you have to actually find out what the candidate candidates studies are what was his experience that does that can be written only in the CSV then we have to see whether this person is like he has written he can speak this language he has this knowledge then that can happen only when we call and speak to that person so we we then we fix up a telephonic then we fix up a telephonic round'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that could be it on the CV'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how'",
        "'speaker_3': 'call and speak exactly call and speak not with the linkedin profile'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly that's the whole point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so this so so that is why we that is why we we rely on linkedin more than facebook because facebook we don't come up with this kind of a candidates'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no see see see you you talk about the you talk about the knowing the person so this could be done through the video call not through the linkedin but you are actually pushing the linkedin or facebook profile but at the but at the end you are somewhere also inclined towards the whole the the the main point which is that the we should the embryo should do the person the right candidate and this should be done through the interaction through the video or voice call so why we are discussing about the linkedin'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course there is everybody does that if you are being selected OK consider your answer you are being selected for a job like say with HCL they don't call you right away OK they send you an they send you a mail stating that we had we have your profile over here and we would like to fix up a telephonic round with you OK so so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh-huh'",

        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't agree to you that because i see uh social media like has see everything has a negative and positive if you take anything it is not only for for anyway life is having negative and positive without negative positive positive is not happening without positive negative will not happen so it is it is always there so you need to choose the good and you need to remove the bad OK so that is why these recruitment organization go'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i think uh these crowd plot these social media platforms are just to connect us to connect us with the right employees with the right employers and we should not just rely our decision on the basis of what we see on their profiles is what i'm saying that's why social media is a good way to connect with these people but we should not make our decisions on how we see their profiles and what they seem to be as on their profiles and what they put out'",

        "'speaker_1': 'alright see O if if you uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see social media background checks actually if you checks a lot you can actually red flag certain candidates OK so by actually because you're not selecting everybody because you will be actually going through a lot of profiles resumes and things and even you will actually now short list them like out of hundred so'",

        "'speaker_2': 'run'",

        "'speaker_1': 'of course we have to select'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course you have to be selective you can't call everybody you can't call everybody because you need to choose the person who is right for the candidate and who has the caliber because if he has mentioned it on on his resume then we'll have to call and find out whether whatever he said on his resume this is what you have mentioned on your resume you have said that you have L one L two you have done L one and L two support so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for which company was it and how long have you done that for so business because why we are asking this this is we are asking that question to him because we as written it on us'",
