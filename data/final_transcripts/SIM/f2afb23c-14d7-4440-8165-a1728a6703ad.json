        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if they went to school you got all sorts of educations about the food groups and how to eat and and and everywhere you turn it tells you how you're supposed to eat well it's up to the parent makes the bad choice sitting around eating bon bons watch TV and it shares that with the kids that's what the kids do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but but'",

        "'speaker_1': 'you're kidding me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'things change the education changed so by the time i had my twenty eight year old child even then they were saying don't give him cereal until he's two months old so in two years two years and two months exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'not kidding you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'things changed so i needed to be educated again even though i knew what i was doing with my oldest i had to be reeducated because the things that change'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i'm sorry to interrupt you but i have to give mister roberts some credit here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the fathers are are very just as important as the mothers'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i'm making it simple here i'm making a little bit simple between a candy bar and a good dinner i get that but that's the bottom line i think i think most parents most adult'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what's this here yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not though because that's not the choices that parents are having to make'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes they do they they give they get their food stamps they go to the grocery store and buy either good food or bad food and they're told they got all sorts of information and about what to buy the food pyramids like christian mentioned and all sorts of other things about what to buy but they they they they buy the easy stuff to buy where they can put it in front of the TV'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when i was for food stamps i never got that information'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i'm saying you're equating being on food stamps being given that information and i wasn't is what i'm telling you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not a local newspapers'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well i mean it's if if you if you grew up if you went to grade school and high school that stuff was talked about all sorts of times i guarantee it even even like in even even today more so now and i'm an old man i'm sixty two years old and they thought it back back you know forty years ago and'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well you know it really hasn't it if you it really hasn't if you if you're eating decent foods you know and you but we keep we keep going away from the exercise a big part of that i've never here in my area there's a sixteen year old kid he weighed like three hundred and fifty pounds and he was playing football and unfortunately he was at the football practice he died well he was he was so overweight and so out of shape you know what the what do you expect if you're if you're so out of shape and overweight that's what happens'",
        "'speaker_3': 'quite a bit of it has changed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you you don't let these things happen you you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well it it lies if your kid is overweight it definitely the responsibility lies with the parent to change that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right i mean you you you your parents sees this kid you know turn into a balloon do you keep feeding them like that but the problem is is mom and dad are probably that looked that way too and you see that when you go out you see you see a family and you see mom and dad overweight kids overweight mom and dad decent you know not overweight the kids are usually that same way why is that because it's a lifestyle is this one chose to live this way this one chose to live that way which we all have choices but that's what they want to do that's their business and unfortunately it passes on the kids and unfortunately those kids are gonna pass it on to their kids'",
        "'speaker_2': 'true'",
