        "'speaker_4': 'and it's it's it's a it's a it's a good spot it's a good starting point for our debate actually standardized testing can help us to identify when marginalized groups are not doing so well because obviously because we've got the same conditions and the same questions in our testing then that helps us to identify which groups are doing less well so i would i would say that that are marginalized groups are actually helped by this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well then then i'm i'm sorry i just i want to add something so then why do we have in schools especially let's say in england you have sex set for mathematics so that is one to eight let's say the same for english as well language and then the children are sitting the same exam yet the teachers are in knowledge ing that there is a need to teach differently children right and not everyone can grasp it and when we are coming to standardized exam we are still'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'expected to deliver everyone at the same level'",

        "'speaker_1': 'what what i'm gonna'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and we don't have another solution for it like like it's it's one one thing criticizing every system you can talk about every economic system on the planet or everything and also you know you talked about the unequal distribution it has very little to do with standardized testing it has a lot more to do with how the society is generally set up and there are some laws of nature believe it or not that exist everywhere if you read about the prettiest distribution eighty twenty law exists in everything'",

        "'speaker_2': 'no but that's that's a that's a very weird statement because i the cricketers are judged based on their skill so they they're there isn't some sort of objective testing of course but it's it's not on written exam it's more how can you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because pushing and they feel they're centralizing them and they fail'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say i would say cricket is the ultimate objective measure because the more runs you score the better you are it it's a perfect example of a it's a perfect example of an objective system'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no'",

        "'speaker_1': 'it's like it must yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we need some sort of objective'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just because you are good at maths just just because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'based on their ability to pass tests which is very important and use their knowledge in an effective way'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'way to testing yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so why don't we look at actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in your interest of him'",
        "'speaker_3': 'absolutely i agree with you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on the under the same conditions and with the same questions and without any bias from teachers'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it it it it it's it's bonkers so so if if i show up at old trafford and asked enough OK can you put me in for like twenty minutes because i really want to play i'm not really good at it he will like bugger off like you can't play football'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm only i'm only ten minutes from old trafford so i'll go i'll go for you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but no but like what we are talking about school no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah it it'll make me really happy and it'll help myself esteem and everything like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and what is this you you know no no no you said first you start with learning right or you are attending at least something where you even in a park you if you want to play'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly right bonita you're yeah you're sticking to that one yeah that says'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i can kick a ball i can run for forty five minutes i'm i'm asking for ten minutes so why not give me a shot'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no of course yeah but if you're no of course but if you want to be a fighter pilot and if you're really zero in math you cannot be a fighter pilot even you even you have like even you even if you have no even if you have like a good consciousness and every'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah and and for a good reason and for a good reason for for everyone 's safety'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know what after this argument i think i'm gonna put you on a plane with the pilot does not know mathematics you can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they will not even allow you to travel in the plane you know man'",
        "'speaker_4': 'science subjects science subjects are much easier to do objective test with anyway so i think for anything science wise i think it's definitely in in the in the good idea to do it because you need to know who knows the right answer and it doesn't i mean if you're gonna be like if you're gonna be an artist or a musician or something like that that it's not so important for you but that that's what testing is all about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but like why science i like what what's that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and there's no objective testing for artists like like like if you're good you're good if you're not you're not yeah yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'after you pass like certain like phase of your life'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right so there is a point that if you don't have standardized exams like enough right you are creating a very unique piece of work so why don't we follow another field'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and do a pass test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah no but maybe because we do not want unique pilots because i want to be sure that i'll get to my destination i don't want some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but you can't fairly manage that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah that's that's that's it i don't want him to do flips and like do all sorts of trickery'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i want i want a pilot that could do colour'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a bit of creativity you never know what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's it's it's it's it's nice that i want don't want to roll it's the same with a lot of fields a lot of scientific development is based on objective testing and that's how people get to the top and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i've do you think we got this for i think we got where we can have these things that actually computers and things it's all objective it's all done by objectiveness so why are we giving it up now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and thank god for not being us like like so fragile and so sort of against hierarchies and like it's it's not a perfect system i'm not complaining saying that it's a perfect system but it's a good enough system or that's the only practical system that we have at this point'",
