        "'speaker_2': 'was it uh high end retail stores'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bars restaurants airlines so when it's to see is there anybody that is a strong'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for this against this on companies being able to hire people based on their appearance'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i was also in the four but if anyone needs to if i have to be against i can go against also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so it it sounds like you guys are mostly four but it it would also depends on the type of the type of business so is is there a i guess is there a line that any of you have where you'd say no it's not OK when it comes to this type of company this type of restaurant or whatever the case is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for me i think like ID companies is not OK like where also the mind like how much intelligence is needed depending on the intelligence the work is done it's not good to hire based on appearance appearance because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'up their intelligence matter more than the how how a person looks like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah that's that's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would think it depends like hooters it's known for the hooters so that would be a job that they have to hire based on appearance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh even sex for that matter they have to choose females or something like taco bell'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or even olive garden people weren't going there for the look at the good people they're going there to get the food so i i think it's more of the aim why why is this business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the way it is is a business there because they have a aim it's a strip club so you're going to look at sexy people or is this a place that you're going just for the service that it it they're doing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what if i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that's the line'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK what if i'm going to a retail shop like a mall and if they only hire a good looking people or a hot people in the shop where they are selling something and will a person who have everage look will be able to go for the products to improve their beauty or like weight loss products or anything which is related to the appearance in front of the hot looking people or like good looking people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if maybe it makes sense to in this kind of industry where it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh people where they can go with their own flows and buy a flaw and buy products which we didn't need also can be considered in retail industry'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah i think i think that's simple so it it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i think there is some bias and maybe it's intentional maybe you know it's not intentional but if it is just a regular restaurant or even a regular retail establishment that somebody might hire somebody'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that uh they feel like their appearance is a better fit obviously if the you know if they're more attractive maybe they want them as the hostess even if it's an olive garden do you think that is OK kinda having if they want somebody more attractive in that front position even though if that's not really in their job description'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK uh again as a diner also mentioned earlier that it depends on the industry and like in other industry like strip clubs we need a people based on appearance but what if in as you said if we if they hire person on top position who is good looking and as a host as a good looking but if that person doesn't have a good communication skills then it will also doesn't make sense so then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there has to be two two requirements which have like communication skills and the appearance which can be considered both like just a good appearance will not work there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no with olive garden you got someone good looking that could get you to your seat or you got someone that is not that good looking but extremely friendly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would think the extremely outgoing friendly person that could get you the street would be more appealing than the good looking person that just like hi let me take you to your seat'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so in that case like that i don't think it should be based on looks it should be based on personality cause personality to me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is more appealing than the looks when it comes to a place that you're going there for that friendly atmosphere and the food so yeah i don't think they it olive garden should not hire based on appearance'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK i i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'true'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we should look at the bigger picture as well of course we're right if we are saying that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when will the meeting it to maybe cosmetic shops restaurants and or how about we say companies that maybe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have you seen for a specific kind of look their employees should have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the sense that for instance it's not a beauty company'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and even in beauty company it should be all encompassing when i mean all encompassing i mean in talking about beauty you're not just referring to a particular of course if you're talking about just a particular target audience then it's it's perfectly OK but if you're looking at the world as you as your marketplace then i don't think that beauty should be limited or restricted to a particular way because of course what looks beautiful to you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'might not look beautiful to me so i would say that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you're employing people as a company HR or something or generally a company or the company policy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'different kind of people i'm not like i said when i started i'm not just limiting it to to restaurants or beauty shops or cosmetic shops or anything like that i'm i'm looking at the bigger picture here so i'm saying that where'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'even when you need a certain you know they're beautiful people from all races from all colors you know they're beautiful people in different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'shapes sizes and all that so yes i would say for me like everyone else it's a four but insane it's a four we should look at the bigger picture'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that makes sense'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well look at me well you you can't see me i don't wanna make up so if i were to work a work at a makeup counter would i really do a good job how could i be telling people ohh you need this eye shadow this blush this this lipstick when i'm not worrying it myself to me it's kind of a conflict you could say now if someone calls in sick and they're like hey can you work to make them counter that's one thing but i wouldn't picture a company purposely picking me to work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the makeup calendar when i don't work myself i think someone that wears makeup would do a much better job and they would look better too cause makeup easy makes people look better i'm just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lazy i guess you could say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'person looks like and if they hire someone who who doesn't look like who doesn't look fit then it will not do a good job in attracting new customers because they occasion will be if you don't have a employee who it's her herself or himself is not a fit how you can make us fit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'here'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly exactly and and i think that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_1': 'course it could be appealing oh go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a that's a part of the discussion too depending on the industry what type of uh look they're going for i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know that there might be like a tattoo parlor somebody doesn't have tattoos they might they might not hire them because their parents have not having tattoos'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we obviously those you know there might be specific things obviously a gym you don't yes you want people that look fit so that you can get people in there that wanna be fit but what do you think about just overall if a company 's you know they feel like they're culture is better if they have but it's just more fit better looking people so they try to hire that and we're talking about like an office job if they feel like that's gonna be better you think that is wrong if if they go that direction and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and try to intentionally do that even though these people are not the face of the company or anything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that is wrong'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that's wrong because especially if it's a company and even when you think about the fitness company they are different different departments in fitness companies so for instance i'm a marketer trying to market obese people trying to tell them ohh OK this is why worse before because of course when you're trying to sell a product to someone to say OK i can actually get as big as you and if i work consistently on my weight'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah me too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'jim i would lose this much weight within this you know setting duration of time so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if i'm trying to sell a particular product then i need someone who has weight you know because for instance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can't as a slim person if i'm slim you know i can't be selling them fitness no no no let me know use the word fitness now let me say slimming teas i can't sell slimming teas to someone who is obese'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know so i would say in different parts of the company you have different departments and different ways to fit in people so in doing this there's a place for everyone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then again for companies like the moderator rightly said for companies where these are not you know there are some companies that might that might feel that ohh we want a specific or a particular look for employees we want them to be from maybe this race you know we want them to have long hairs we that and all this superficial looks has nothing to do with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the character the the the qualifications of some of these people applying to them or the people who are intending to work with them so i would rightly say that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this shouldn't be considered you know it shouldn't be considered and in areas where they need to be considered there is always a place or a room for many people or a room for everybody'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah that's right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree to it like for as as you are said that how about office job i would say like sometimes a good looking people are considered more trustable but if they are also considered like there's a thing called like like good looking girl sometimes they are conceited less intelligent also this is like biased which exist i would say and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as i mentioned earlier like in tech jobs and all so there is also bias based on appearances like if they if if someone is good looking people concede ohh OK that person just got a job based on the looks not on the intelligence what this person have or a communication skills or overall personality that's also a bias due to appearances which are sometimes considered where the intelligence is more needed than a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the bimbo'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'overall looks and other uh other superficial things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i think i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i could see go ahead'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now go ahead diane jumping'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i could see companies doing that too though i mean you are in a regency room you gotta wait hours and hours and hours'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's nice to have some nice eye candy there at the counter the stair at while you're waiting these hours and hours and hours so i could see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that being a case'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i could see them pulling their best looking person that scaled the and i didn't take to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yet when it comes right down to it does it really matter in the emergency room how good looking the person is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no it won't and that that was going to leave me to you know one of the examples they gave was airlines which i think is an interesting industry because when you look at the stewardess flight attendants whatever you wanna call them that i think is something that some airlines do try to hire attractive people in those positions and they probably because they feel like OK this helps you know you're stuck on a on a plane and small seat having somebody that looks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more attractive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh could help the morale of people would give them a better flight experience do you think like without industry obviously that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the possibly distract them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah depreciate distract them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i would choose a person in a airline industry who has a better smile than who has looked good looking if a person because i think overall this smile makes a person if they're approachable or a friendly or not like if there's a person very good looking person but just not smiling and just having a straight face and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not uh that person will not be friendly and appealing to me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know about others but in my case i would not like to have a person who is just good looking and not having overall personality as diana also mentioned earlier'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes and i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think so too i think so too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and obviously i i feel like a lot of it is gonna be pointed at the male consumers as well so it's interesting to get you know thoughts from from you guys but yeah i feel like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that it does sway men some and they probably as overall probably cared less about OK if it's somebody a little less friendly but better looking i'd rather have them as my waitress or flight attendant'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is it OK i guess and then that goes back to the question is it OK for companies if they feel like you know a good percentage of our customers are men this is gonna help us with profits so we wanna hire more attractive people maybe maybe we only wanna hire females in that position instead of males at what point i guess do we cross the is that line crossed into the that's that shouldn't be allowed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there was a one airline industry i know which only hired female staff because females weigh less than male and it costed them less fuel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so they only hired'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'only female staff so depending on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like we're company what company wants to do like they did it because they wanted to save money'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course one thing with hiring thin people because they're thin people don't always stay thin their whole life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so you can also send fire them because they've got pregnant and gained thirty pounds and never lost it after they had their child or or whatever the situation is too'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah but that that could lead us to also to the discussion of so i obviously there are things you know in the US i think most countries have like hiring practices it's illegal to discriminate you know race gender'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sexual orientation i think it's in you know some places religion so you know should there be anything that is put in place to try to make sure companies aren't hiring just off of appearance is it certain industries that there's there should be something in place so that doesn't happen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there can be ethical loss which should be in place which makes that like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we there are already laws which says raise gender and other biases which shouldn't be considered also it can be there can be a ethical law which says you cannot hire only good looking people but how how you will measure it like on what basis you can measure like if a person is good looking or not it can be said that for me it's not a good looking a company can give'",
        "'speaker_4': 'against that yeah that person doesn't look good for me it's just i'm i hired because of the requirements of the position'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they they can be ethical laws but how how do you measure it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that i mean that's a good question and then you know you look at a a place like hooters obviously as far as i know they haven't had any lawsuits against them for waitresses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so right now it doesn't seem like there's any way to do that but you know could there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know could that even work and then obviously you know other positions that hooters if you're cooking the wings i don't think they care'",
        "'speaker_2': 'about gender or appearance or anything so i guess that could save them as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't think they should make any laws like that the government i mean the government already trying to make a law that if you have company over a hundred people you have to have them all have the covid vaccine i i think that we don't want i don't like the idea about the government getting in control of all these companies and making them do certain things yes you need to hire on scale for the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so people of all different races and everything could be good at that scale'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but then again hooters the skill is they look good so you are a hiring according to the skill so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it's this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't i don't think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the government should make a law it has to be you can't hire good people and like what was said before is how do you judge everyone has different judges on good looking people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of course of course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so yeah so i think i mean at the end of the day a lot i mean it comes down to obviously their companies are trying to make money so if they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i i would agree that it's it's a i think it's tough to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'actually figure out OK how do you how would you put someone in place as far as hiring based on appearance and then and then trusting yeah trusting your government to actually be able to do that effectively is not probably not the easiest thing to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to count on so it does it come down more to you know if if i i can't remember the name of the company it was one of the retail stores that were only hiring like a certain look and they kind of got bad press i don't think there's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh that is abercrombie i think abercrombie and finch'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK OK where were there lawsuits against them or is it just the bad person'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no there was no lawsuit against them it was just they hire like cool kids or like models because they said ohh we want to attract the customer based on that only like we want to only serve to the customer who who are known as school cares or model looking people so that was their argument against it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah so in a situation like that you know maybe they lost some business potentially i know there were there was you know a little bit out there i don't know if people maybe stop shopping there because of that but i guess that's how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know that's how it kind of like let the market take care of it if if somebody is doing that then people can let it be known and say you know i don't wanna support that business i guess that you know that's one way that you could potentially take care of the situation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's possible'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think so as social media is like right now playing a big role in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'poem weekend home which where like people are judged right now and we who who should be followed or who should not be so it can be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh choose and by'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my social media but it can go again give them a good publicity also bad publicity or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's true haven't haven't bad bad publicity yet'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah so i think i mean they there are times where company might go over the line but yes you know as as diane said you know trusting government to actually put in a some sort of regulation is not it's not gonna be easiest thing to do so if you guys think it then it's it's fine people call out companies and i know cancel cultures also a debatable thing but you call out companies for only hiring certain thing and then try to basically try to influence them that way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i i think that yeah the canceled culture but i don't think the government should be i think the government is trying to get too much control of companies more and more i mean there's laws that they tried to put in place that thankfully failed that the government was trying to control companies and i think the government has too much control already over companies and trying to get more so i don't want them to have control over whether or not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this this thing or anything else'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i agree with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's true like there are already many laws which has to be based on gender and also other races that you should have like these kind of people in the company also there are sometimes those kind of rules made'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah exactly and there's there's a lot now and it i was my worry with the more the more laws you have the more lawsuits you have and there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits and it just becomes it just becomes a mess and ends up costing ends up costing taxpayers money off those court cases and you know backing up the courts because somebody sued because they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah for whatever reason they didn't get hired and it might have been protected as long as it's not you know i think the core ones do matter obviously what race and gender and those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah let's say in in trying to for some companies in trying to avoid that or in learning from their past mistakes i see that so much trying to be inclusive you know in the advertisements and they are employing habits in trying to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead esther'",
        "'speaker_3': 'reach out to different kinds of people i'm not just referring to a particular look i'm referring to racist you can see why you can see caribbeans you can see africans you know it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we are getting there i would say but not as fast as i would the wanted to but in a way it's it's headed it's headed somewhere'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but when people don't hire on skill that's the problem and that's why'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that's another problem with the government getting too much control of certain rules is all of a sudden you're hiring ohh i need a female to work here because i have ten males no female you're hiring that female because there are female not because they have the skill for the job so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i actually think i think that point depends on the industry'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know because there's only so far looks can get here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you get to a point where indeed your skills need to come up so it depends on the industry they are industries or their businesses where a bimbo like i'm sorry to say but someone who's got nothing going on in their heads can work so yeah there's only so much your looks can get you because at the end of the day at some point you need to prove your skills'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but like as jenna mentioned like about this female ten people like if they're ten male members and one then they have to hire a female one female sometimes i feel that this is always taken as a negative point because in a tech industry it's always considered if a woman is hired like ah you are a female so you had easy option to get into a tech field because tech job because you are a female sometimes it's also seen like that which i think is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so doesn't mean doesn't mean i trying to say that's in some industries or for instance the tech field like you pointed out that the requirements'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh possibly usually reduced when it has to do with women'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it was the same requirement just they say that OK you are a female so they hired you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just because they want diversity i mean when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah there's there's definitely a push for more more diversity in industries and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but i think so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and to me that when you're not expiring on skill but hiring on the fact to try to make a diversified it's it's not right and and but that's when the government gets too much control and pushes this diversity'",
        "'speaker_3': 'qualification'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i mean you look at the president 's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'he has like everything he has'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean every single thing there is in his thing he has'",
        "'speaker_1': 'everything all nation people that think they're females that are males and all these kind of things he has everything and sometimes you look or i look at that like OK did he hire them because their skill foot or did he hire them because he wants to have this diversity so to me it's a negative because i think ohh he hired all these different people because of he wants diversity now i could be wrong and misjudging and i shouldn't do that but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i think i think there's yeah but hiring on skills should be you know being able to get the job done should be the you know the main goal obviously if there's there's a situation i think i think the intended point behind some laws now that if there's two equally qualified people and everybody at the company is male everybody at the company is whatever that you go with the other person to have more diversity obviously that's not always gonna work out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then if if you see a company that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there is somebody just as skilled'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and is not getting hired that's where i guess the the issues would happen legally but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course you'll go back just overall appearance that doesn't seem to be able to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'workout to but when it comes to gender and race so they obviously the two big ones'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well in the election for maryland for the democrat side the primary'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they had it that you had the vote for four men four women had to be equal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i looked at that and it's like to me that's just not right because now you're you're not voting on who's the best person for the job you're voting on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who i gotta make sure it's equal and it might not be four and four i forgot exactly how it was i just know it was equal men equal woman and to me that's like that's just that right and then when it comes to the main election it's gonna the other side the republicans didn't have that role just a democrat so all said now that role is not going to be in effect anymore so whether it's the females are better for the job or the males are better for the job you should vote the best person for the job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so that bothered me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was since he with that example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that could come back also to like you know we talked about the companies and their profits but as in that situation it's a if the process doesn't work out for the democrats and they lose the general election because of that i bet you then they'll end up switching with like oh that was a mistake so that's something that could be worked out too if you put in a system where you're not getting the most qualified person which we're we're talking about companies in this but also i guess the government had also could apply there as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the the government 's a big company itself we just select them in we we elect in our boss our governor seems our boss sometimes we don't know so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah basically'",
