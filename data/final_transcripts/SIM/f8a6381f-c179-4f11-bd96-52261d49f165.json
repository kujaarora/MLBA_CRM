        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'preferred to go in knowing nothing and then learning as i was going up because coming in from a very overarching kind of viewpoint knowing a lot about a variety of things it was OK and it did help me in certain circumstances but also i felt like they expected me to be at this level which i didn't feel as though'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i was so that's this really high expectation of if you've got a degree you should know your stuff you should know what you're doing and you should come into this job able to start get the ball rolling obviously there's like a little bit of grace period where you kind of settle in and things but they expect you to kind of know what you're doing and i did not feel like i did but starting the job as kind of as from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm that can happen right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'working your way up and them teaching you everything they don't expect you to know as much they expect that you're expected to teach you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but most of the companies most of the companies they don't want to want you to they don't want to pay you you to learn so this is what i have experienced a lot and i think in my opinion if i have a dream job'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i will go with the very strong response to them because if i have some limited understanding of the field some limited credentials or lack of personal development i could risk my my my job or i could risk the staying of myself in the company for longer than six months because in the country that i live in here we have a probation period of six months if you don't do good you will the company will not proceed with you so i think'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and they're giving you all this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's that's why you do the hard work before end and then go and into the market so do it as yourself you should not allow anyone to stress you out you should do the hard work yourself i think'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so there are specific job roles for them there are specific areas where there is a starting point for everyone from there they can start it should not be an executive position it could be a trainee position and then they can grow but companies have to introduce those kind of positions because not everybody can be a machine learning site test or not every everyone can be AI engineer this is my point'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think as well there is it's also interesting i think that like something like a college degree after you you're going for maybe your second or even your third job those sort of things disappear because it's then purely on the job experience and it really depends on the role as well i mean so say like if you're doing something sales related to be honest with you i don't think they're gonna really care if you've got a college degree if you're producing the numbers for them then then then they're really happy for that i mean and'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah because i guess it's a learning lot of like theories and stuff like there's these formulas and theories that you need to know to be able to do it but then other jobs aren't so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but what if you're aiming for some sensitive kind of job and the company will not hand you the job if you don't have the if you don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'experience because it's like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'qualify the prerequisites'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's like putting the door the foot in the door if you have a college degree they might look at your CV but if you don't have on the job experience like i helped transform this company with blah blah blah blah blah and you don't have a couple of those then it's it's an issue with how am i ever going to start that's the other side of that'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you want to be yes yes if you want to get noticed you have to have something to show them if you don't have anything they will not able to treat you nicely and then if i think it's very rude that just to just return the TV without saying anything because i've been to some companies they told me'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then just condensing stuff really really fast and those are sort of things that i will admit i mean in terms of sort of on the job stuff that was quite useful is it is it'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right so there's a lot of invaluable things that you learned from going to college or perhaps from having the independent lifestyle as well like you know going out after eighteen and trying to spread your wings in the real world but i guess here the college degree more important than on the job experience my issue there of course is getting my degree is highly it's specified for a couple different things and you learn you do learn a lot of foundational skills in school'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i think this should be it is this a better idea because if you are not encouraging the industry then you you know how to stand on your feet and you should go out and tell people that OK tell the market that i can do this if you have a better way to do this come confront me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wow do you think though that like so say someone that could maybe learn to learn'",
