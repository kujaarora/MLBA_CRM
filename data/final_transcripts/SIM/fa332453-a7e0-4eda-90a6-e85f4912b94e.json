        "'speaker_1': 'and this is the animal testing one am i right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it is i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'meet up snack just to make sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't wanna have the wrong session up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes is animal testing justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so when i start the i've started the recording already when i prompted to do so we're gonna do a introduction it's a testing testing of the audio where we're gonna introduce ourselves and say a quick phrase'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the phrase is going to be the quick brown the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i will start that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so my name is brittany and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm charlene the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i am christian and the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hi i'm rebecca the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thank you so much for that and before we start the debate i'd like to ask'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who's wearing a headset and who's open mic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'once a headset'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a headset'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i would be an open mic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'christians on open mic and charlene and rebecca on headsets'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK that's perfect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so the topic is is animal testing justified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think it absolutely is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's well i love animals and i currently i mean i have six animals in my house right now but i think that people are always more important than animals and so if we can use animals to further medical research or research of any kind and i think it's it's absolutely justified'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if you think about the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think as long as the animal is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm just gonna go ahead and i just think it's long as the animals are treated as humanely as possible and i also think like the the benefits outweigh the the negatives like human life should go first before an animal life and if testing animals is helping saving human lives i think it can be justified yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'never from bread for that purpose as well aren't they especially mice they're they're bread so that they can do all of this testing if think about the coronavirus the vaccine that they developed so quickly i don't think they would have been able to have done that without the help of animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think so yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and we're all very grateful for that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as far as i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as far as i know you can't even do any vaccine trials without animals beforehand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because it would be way too dangerous to put it into the human like directly you need animals otherwise you would not have vaccines'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly and it's not just for medication it's not just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah a safe vaccines'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it's actually mandatory in order to have vaccines to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sorry it's not just for medications either it's it's all kinds of different treatments and just kind of what disease processes are in that too they can find out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK guys so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm going to stop this recording here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK what's wrong'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'let's see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'shantanu II hopefully i'm saying that correctly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah shantanu'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK i'm gonna have to ask you to drop out your being the last person in the room'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't be worried you'll still be halfway compensated for this complete meeting we just only need four participants ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bless you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thank you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bless you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so we're back on i'm sorry about that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think i kind of come from come at this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and at this object kind of from a unique perspective i have a very rare medical condition'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh and unless some some very serious researchers have done very very soon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's a condition that i'll be gone in a few years with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'slash'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i am'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh wow sorry to hear that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean i'm not i'm not trying to say that to get sympathy or anything you know i'm just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anything that they can do to understand this disease better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm so that at least even if we can't find a cure for it right now there's not really anything to need treatment to to like treat the symptoms so even if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'even if it doesn't help me at the can help people after me that have this at least'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can i have a better quality of life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then i mean i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's just no question as far as i'm concerned'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and there were no alternatives either rather if there was an alternative that someone suggested a different way of you know testing things without using these animals then then fair enough but but there aren't any alternatives so like you said before like humans are more important at the end of the day'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'just because i see something different on the screen than i'm used to seeing i'll have to ask you rebecca are you using the installed app or are you using the web based browser'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the app'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK thank you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at the meet you say my phone name because it's i have teams installed for work so i have to do it through there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK thank you for explaining'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so one thing i wanted to point out about the topic is that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you could help find the allergies of the animals'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and potentially provide a living environment for them free from those allergens that we find'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we could then form'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even a better trust with the animals to wear doesn't have to end up being harmful to either humans or animals in that sense'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm sorry you were a bit cut off so didn't under i hear the whole question correctly there if you might'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i saying that it is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as a human race'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when we're doing animal testing if we were to make studies to where we are dedicated to finding the actual allergies of these animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then we could find other answers and if we if we know their allergies we could then provide a living environment for them free from the allergen so we would be helping human and animal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i say this because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's what my pros list is finding the allergens for the animals on the cons list i also have like if the allergies of the animal is unknown it could cause faulty results'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah well they they say don't they that and the the animals are built differently their genetics are different to humans so so there were no guarantees that what the result is from the animals that that will have the result in humans anyway so there is a risk factor there but yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which would essentially that is not really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's why they have to do such control testing once they get to human testing everything has to be so very controlled with that is because there is that risk'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i mean ninety i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if you take if you take chimpanzees for example they are like ninety nine percent the same DNA as humans so it's like kind of like the nearest to a human so it's there's still a similarity but when you actually see how many drugs go through or are OK by animal trials and how many actually in the end approved by human trials i don't know the exact percentage but it's probably around like five or ten percent right so but i would still say like there is there is there is some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they to it so it shows us it definitely i think the harmful ones and then it's just about selecting UM which ones are correct and there's also one element like a lot of the side effects'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'why a drug might not get on the market an animal might not be able to pass that on for example if it is if a drug causes an ache in the ankles or in the joints and animal cannot speak so it cannot communicate that so there's maybe some side effects which in human trials are coming to light because humans can communicate them better than animals'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and also the long term effects because what a lot of times animals a lot of the animals that they test on have such a shorter lifespan compared to people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we we can't really know what the long term effects are gonna be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that's another issue and that's why a lot of times medication will be on the market for years and then all of a sudden oh but it's doing this that and the other thing ohh you know we've been taking it for years but they don't know they don't have any way of knowing that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that was one of the problems with all the everything they developed for and coronavirus that they did all of these tests but actually you know you you know different conversation whether you you know believe or not in the vaccines but let's assume most people do take the vaccines actually there's no real way of knowing the long term effects of that because it was all developed so quickly but then you have to weigh up the pros and the cons of having that vaccine don't you and trust the people that are in charge and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and putting it together'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well that's the thing like about emily will testing we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'give me just not much transparency at least where i'm coming from so you don't hear or see my many pictures about it or hear many stories about it so if it's actually cruel or if it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now because the animal rights activists will get all up in arms about it so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but how how much how humane it is is like more like a trust thing i would say where i'm from so i'm kind of like trusting that they treating it humanely because they're scientists and you think they're like educated people so on an ethical ethical plane'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think times are different now as well compared'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i trust them to do them as as good as possible'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah sorry compared to twenty thirty years ago and you know you do have a bit more trust in in the people who are the scientists nowadays whereas i know when i was younger there was still you know a lot of makeup was being tested on animals and contained you know like lipsticks contained the skin of dolphin or you know crazy things that we look back at now and think gosh how was that how was that allowed so you do like to think that times have changed for the better'",
        "'speaker_3': 'please'",
        "'speaker_1': 'oh yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but i think i still think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i don't see where it could be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i i would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry brittany i can't hear you very well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i i do see where it could cause quite quite a controversy in different areas'",
        "'speaker_2': 'while i'm having this conversation my uh my outlook on it is changing as this conversation progresses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at first i was kind of thinking that keeping these animals in captivity as you were saying they could be bred for this purpose keeping those animals in captivity could be considered cruel and at first i was going to say because they are being captured'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and there are lives are being belittled as as as a living creature to help another living creature that has already been probably considered ill in some type of way but now i'm kind of viewing it as in what kind of captivity could they be kept in in because if you are breeding a certain species'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in an environment where they're not really being shown care for and then you're using'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that medication on people and trying to tell us that those people are cared for instead of being put in the same type of captivity as those animals are not not believing it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he will you can say the same thing about you know the the meat we and the views of vegetarians and other people you know like you would choose free range eggs rather than eggs from chickens that have been kept in cages you know that kind of thing you you eat the produce but you like to think that it's come from a from a caring background which is which is contradictory in itself really but you like to think that they've been looked after'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think that's an interesting point like if you are against animal testing you should be also against eating meat because it's kind of like the same thing right you're breathing an animal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh in order to eventually kill it and in the first in the first example you eat it in the second'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah you would assume that that those people who were against animal testing also have strong views about eating meat yeah you would assume that wouldn't you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it improves your health'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i do believe that those types of things have correlations'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and and then then that's also where i just kinda go hand in hand and if done correctly and carefully it could create a trust not only between the scientist and consumers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i trust and naturally it could create a trust and a naturally safer relationship with humans and animals because if we are having these animals that can go into the wild and completely'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mixing mingle and survive for so long as long as they don't come in contact with humans we could learn so much from them by not killing them they could probably even show us these other ways but they're probably so scared to come near us because of the actual meat eaters they've been watching humans tear down tear them down for so many years so i don't even know how beneficial it could be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to test our things on them if we are doing it this way if we were to like the this is why i mentioned helping the animals also animals have allergies so if they see if you have a whole animal family and they know that there's one specific house and the people in that house tend to use animals for testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and don't care like they just use the animals and then throw them away left for dead they're not really gonna like that house they might even try to harm those people i can't blame them for it versus if you have a whole family of animals that know of a house that does research for like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'animal allergies you could then gain a trust with those animals because they're like you know that house right there they actually wanna help they they saw what happened when i ate that leave and they nursed me back to hell what could i do for them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there's a respect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and we're not talking about like dangerous animals here we're talking about just just animals in general because us if you look in our textbook we are still considered an animal'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah there's a there's an issue with respect to there isn't there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and yeah we see lots of examples of where animals aren't treated with respect you know i'm not talking about animal testing i'm just talking generally you know we see some horrific things on the news so it it it it all comes down to respect the same width animal testing but yeah it works both ways doesn't it like you say we're all we're all animals people we're all the they're all the same really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what would be really interesting is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and charlene while you were talking then i was just thinking and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if the if there wasn't any animal testing i know that it's been like happening for years in years a long long time but it'll be interesting to see i wonder if anyone 's done a study to see if there hadn't been any animal testing her what would life be like now i'd be really interested to see something like that yeah so i come back to the my example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now that would be really interesting yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean it's every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it didn't use people we didn't used to test on animals years and years ago'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK 'cause i can't remember a time when we didn't test so how how long has'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no wait'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we wouldn't remember a time i mean this was back when you know it was the country doctor that was trained by the previous country doctor before there was medical schools and things like that you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm talking like you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sixteen seventeen eighteen hundreds'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh there wasn't testing then they just kind of tested it on people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i would think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it would be interesting to know kind of how many people died from that you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bears probably the pros and cons that back in six'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's what i would think like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah back then it was probably more difficult to to keep what people would probably call like wildebeest and and beasts as animals i mean as pets or companions closer to their living quarters versus'",
        "'speaker_3': 'now i'm saying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if and and this is the two parts to every story situation at least you have that those type of lifestyles versus'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they weren't being tested on you they probably weren't being companion iced and it probably was kind of a threat to be around those animals which could have started any type of thing cuz i'm not i'm i'm i am the human right but i'm a mom if i were to see an animal attack my child i'm gonna test it and i'm not gonna test it for health matters'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'dogs became'",
        "'speaker_1': 'docs became'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so dogs became domesticated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'back before there was even written language i mean that was dogs were domesticated'",
        "'speaker_1': 'shortly after humans arrived you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ten thousand years ago yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you know and then cats were shortly after that so i mean we've kind of always had animals as pets and then we started figuring out that they could be used as tools also like for working on the farm and moving things and and kind of the heavy work like that so that was kind of our second use of them and then eventually we kind of figured out once we were able to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'once they got past the whole you know we can't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'kind of figuring out biology and cells and genes they figured out how close some animals were to humans and how a lot of different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like the herbs and the plants that they were using as as medications how those worked similarly and animals as they did in humans and then that kind of went on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'keep the medical testing and the research that they do now so it was all kind of a a step process that began shortly after you know humans began so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i wonder if i wonder if some laws had been brought in to prevent animal testing i wonder if we'd be in a in a different position now would they would have had to have found a different way to produce all of these tests and things wouldn't they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i mean there's they haven't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'been able to find you know besides like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cloning you know that there's really no other way to that i know of that they have found you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i i think it's interesting with charlene said earlier if we let's like like in theory let's say let's say'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we prohibit animal testing what would happen would probably be human testing right so then it would be the poorest of the poor who need the money to to do those tests and then and then i think like after some time comes the question is how many people are actually dying from the testing and how many are getting saved by it because if we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh here's that yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and who do you think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean a lot of now that if you see like for example a lot of testing in terms of like i'll alzheimer disease where they literally like cutting into the chimpanzees brain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm sorry go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'studying at there's not a way of doing it so there would be a huge amount of humans who are actually getting killed and that's i don't know what about result but probably like stagnation in the drug development altogether because how could you advance it further if you are if you are killing humans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i don't think there will be here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so do you know how they tested syphilis treatments in the US'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think i've heard about i forgot it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so they they figured out that the medications that they were using for system will syphilis itself didn't react the same in animals as it does in humans so they couldn't really test the treatments on it if it wasn't the same process and so they paid poor black men'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like three dollars i think it was and said here let me give you some lessons some of you will try to treat with this medication that we don't really know what it's gonna do to you most of them die the ones that didn't die ended up sterile'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know old english you know king arthur says you know what i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the thing about the thing about diseases and syndromes is such as that is especially with syphilis there is always and i mean always different strains because there's no individual except identical twins that might actually haphazardly have these identical situations that they shared in woo mage but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so and it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with any disease saying you have two people with syphilis and they decide to sleep with each other then you have a mega syphilis you don't have just two people with syphilis that joined together now they're OK now you have two different types of diseases coming into play that are gonna form a third'",
        "'speaker_1': 'patiently yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that's like when you have we have mersa method'",
        "'speaker_1': 'madeline resistant'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i don't i don't know it's infection you know what i mean it's it's it's the most'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah in the in the hospitals the multi resistant bacteria yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes so i i had that a few years ago and was in the hospital for like three weeks with it it's horrible'",
        "'speaker_3': 'same yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that's what happens because these things mutate you know when and well and then we give antibiotics for the common cold so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it it leads them resistant to it too but that's why we have so many we've had to keep getting the boosters for the coronavirus you know because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's changing all the time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah we've had so many different variations of it and i personally don't think it's ever gonna be gone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know we're just gonna keep getting more mutated more mutations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no honey'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's gonna stay like the flu like the influencer sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah they seem to have eased off on vaccinations in the in the UK they seem to have eased off on vaccinations at the moment i can't remember the last vaccination i had but there was a time a couple of years ago when i had three quite we have one after the other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's always going to stay here and i think so too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but yeah it will always change wouldn't it and while people are moving around different countries and picking up different variants of it and it's mutating it is just gonna carry on isn't it so yeah we come back to the same argument of what else do you do other than use the animals to test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well it it kind of depends on like where you're going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like i did i did a i did a tour through africa like three years ago and before before i went i needed to get i think seven or eight vaccinations done in in a couple of months so like if you i mean that's huge benefits to it for example if you go to africa where there's still like a lot of infectious diseases are really prevalent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'interesting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so you can see definitely the benefits because if we wouldn't have vaccinations in our society would look the same right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like my grandmother'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so the benefits are huge different they are so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one of my grandmothers had polio because her parents decided that they were too worried about the polio vaccine because they didn't yeah there wasn't enough testing they decided and now my my grandmother still walks with a limp she's got one leg shorter than the other you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm when the UK we have been we have babies and young children that are getting illnesses that we've not seen in the UK for many years because a lot of parents are deciding to not get their children vaccinated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'nice'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep but again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then that's tough that's very tough getting your children vaccinated versus not getting them vaccinated it's a big step what's stops most parents probably is the fact of knowing that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh wow but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you if you already know that knowing is half the battle and acknowledging is it means you're halfway there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm at the point where you are about to let a doctor inject a virus into your child 's really have to think about it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because if they're gonna catch it naturally they're gonna have their natural form if they catch it after they have that vaccine you can bet your bottom dollar dollar it's gonna be bad'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and science backs of the doctors'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it comes back to trust again doesn't it you have to trust i mean yeah this is obviously to my opinion you have to trust what the medical profession saying and if they advised that these vaccinations are going to help your child not just your child but the community that they live in as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the point so many people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then yeah and that's the same as the coronavirus isn't it was always about protecting the community the elderly the vulnerable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so i'm my oldest leaves me being compromise'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i need more towards protecting our youth'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but we do need the older crowd to still lead and guide them so i believe that protecting them equally would be the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the best thing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's why everybody needs to be vaccine vaccinated vaccine listen me that's why everybody needs to be vaccinated'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what no just like with allergens which is why this type of thing started injecting things into people that didn't want things in them to begin with was where they started because say i'm allergic to say i'm allergic to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and so many other people in the mean promise literally'",
        "'speaker_2': 'something in in the air and it causes a rash that someone can catch i'm not letting them inject me with that or like or just because the kid down the street is like that's like saying i know in class you can't bring peanut butter and things like that because if you bring peanut butter in a class and the kid across the room caches that you're gonna get in trouble if it because if the even the airborne smell'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the key could die'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i disagree to that because i'm i'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i i would i would heavily disagree that because i'm i'm i'm heavily allergic against paul and in the springtime i literally need to flee my country because they're the medication is not it's just not enough like my eyes swell everything like my nose is running i'm like i can't even work so if there would be a vaccine against that i would take that immediately like not even thinking about it i would take it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's up to the individual to read the sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i never see you with warnings i'm i'm sorry every vaccine comes with warnings you know there's there's one i can't think of which one it is but if you're allergic to eggs you can't take it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the doctor's let you know ahead of time the doctors won't know if you're allergic to these things you will know so it's not nobody's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it's it's up to you to do your own research isn't it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah nobody said injecting anybody you know against their will or was something that could harm them but if you vaccinating your kids'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_1': 'when there's zero evidence that that's bad for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can help to save my life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's not that there's is zero because the answer isn't zero but OK let's say we go with the flu'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the like lot of other people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my kids don't have the flu they don't use the flu i have had the flu before i remember what i did to get the flu'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because you have cause and effect with everything'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i wouldn't do it again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i remember what i did to get it so now 's before i had kids so now that i have kids i've took the steps to not do that again and my kids don't have it so if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you get the flu going grocery store'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because everyone else 's kid likes to expose them to certain things and they wanna share that at all in the same category doesn't mean that my child needs to be and we're getting completely off topic this is supposed to be about the animals by the way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah the topic is actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is animal why there were still coming to a head on it because since we're still talking about humans i guess the the answer was probably yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'kind of i can't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because we didn't even want to talk about it anymore'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think we all kind of came to a pretty quick consensus that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah we do need to be testing on themselves and then we kind of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh no that's not what i meant i meant that wouldn't really like we couldn't really look the conversation in the face and talk about what we were doing and you know that that's not usually bad that's not usually good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah well i think the only argument against it is it is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wendy i'm sorry say that again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we kind of abandoned the topic like umm it was is is animal testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'justified we kind of got off of the top topic about the animals because that that did leave a pros and cons it seemed like we couldn't stay on the topic very long which meant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well it is related isn't it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think we just have been off of it because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we know it's wrong'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's a topic which is very very pro heavy so you can't really find any consciously con is really against it is if you want to protect the animal life by but by protecting the animal life you pretty much could stagnate like development drug development'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i believe we are too loud'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i just just something i don't think this is really great debate topic just because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think i mean i you know obviously there are people who don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who don't think that it that we should test on animals and you know that that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's up to them but majority'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they need to come forward and suggest a different way of doing it then don't they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm about to i'm i'm literally about to honestly like i i really i really am i'm a very humane person i've been through things my blood type there's only ten percent of us in the world i can't receive blood from anybody i've bought they've already had to save my life so yes i do have a counter for this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for if someone has a situation like i do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the best thing that you can do and within the last like five to six years they've been coming out with more procedures for situations like this and surgeries and such and studies you could instead of donating the animal 's life to your cause'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i'm not saying donate yourself because i don't believe in that we do not need to turn ourselves into jesus and sacrifice ourselves for anybody know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what you could do though is even if it's just a piece of hair on your head or something you could put that into a petri dish'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and you can test whatever it is that is being tested you could put that into your cell under a microphone a microscope if you really know if you really really know that what we're talking about is absolutely correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that would not work for for viruses in most most diseases'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that having having putting something into a cell is a lot different than putting it into a body with all of the different body systems that we have going that's that's not really the same environment it's not gonna test things in the same way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can see i'm trying to help you don't have a few minutes i heard that there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah you you you're immune'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but we want to test on animals that have nothing to do with us from what we said'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but you have to you have to see your immune system is not in your cell your immune system is is in mostly in your blood with your tear blood'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but the animals immune system isn't in us either'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it's close enough to give us some research data to go on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like the correlation is ninety eight ninety nine percent so it's close enough yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the majority i guess so but that's something that i probably will not ever'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly it's close enough'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i wonder if some of the testing can be done on humans and when they're passed away you know how we you know we're say we're happy to be donors for organs and you know have tests'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would never talk to him'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is some stuff like that going on at like places like mayo clinic and cleveland clinic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'where people could you know that people have to voluntarily do it but you know after they after they passed so they know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you got their their brain dead'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's are able to kind of keep their body alive in order to do some tests'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i mean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's two thirty one we've got two thirty minutes of our recording so i'm about to stop the recording'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but it doesn't work as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
