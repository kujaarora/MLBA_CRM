        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i don't think it's OK for companies to hire people based on their appearance i mean to me it seems like that they should be hiring a person based on like who can do the best job if it's a restaurant it's like who's gonna be the best waitress you know if it's a sales person who's going to be the best at selling clothes or whatever and you know a person can't help or control their appearance and i mean people who are not attractive still have'",

        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you think it should it should be the same for every industry or would you make any exceptions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know i think i might make an exception like there are some jobs like modeling or whatever where like kind of the whole goal is to be attractive so i i feel like you have to make some exceptions for like that type of industry where it's all about appearance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'matthew you gotta control argument'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just a macro level'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK i mean the yeah i think there are various industries where it's important to have like a sort of certain appearance and especially things maybe like retail stores where people might want to hire'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and you know someone of a certain appearance to try and project the image that they want and try and attract the certain type of person that they might want to attract to their store and the same with things maybe like i don't know airlines and restaurants where you know some people might be i don't know miller opening friendly to people of a certain look'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",

        "'speaker_3': 'and well that's quite some yeah that's quite subjective i think you know that it might well be that you know say for example like a a restaurant that is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know like over a certain origin might want to hire people of a certain look to try and you know portray like a a sort of'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah there's the well the that obviously comes at a cost and where you know like they they might want to portray a certain image but at the same time they're then risking alienating our large population of people whether it be someone who has like a physical disability or someone of a different ethnic background that's a risk they want to take but that's something they obviously will have to weigh up before they go down that route'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'angela what what what's your take on it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think it's it's not OK to go for this whole thing because you cannot set parameters because matthew is an individual then he would think according to his mentality but there are other people who will think otherwise so what what should be the parameters through this we can decide so the thing is that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's completely not OK to go with this because there are some people who the who are not having good looks but they are smart so i believe that smartness or the efficiency should be the parameter the look the good looking something which is natural like see if someone is having is if someone is going to have the good education so he is responsible for that but if someone is having good looks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK uh yeah i mean with this logic a person who is actually going for the charity organization and asking for money he or she can just show the pictures of the special or handicapped people even the government can say no don't do this but say no it's a morally it's correct i can actually i can use it but in the in in reality he's actually misusing those images'",

        "'speaker_2': 'to have the emotional touch with the people so if this is a parameter then anyone can come up with his own plans and misuse this whole process'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK so then where did you sign on it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i mean you make a really good point about like you know the you don't want the strip club hiring people like based on their intelligence or whatever that doesn't make any sense but then so you could say like well only industries that like had to do like directly like with appearance should be allowed to do that but then like it really gets complicated because don't all industries have something to do with the parents like don't you want like'",

        "'speaker_4': 'right exactly or like the hostess at a restaurant like maybe you're more likely to go into the restaurant if the hostess looks like really pretty and polished and neat like then you think like oh this is gonna be a tasty clean restaurant so like then it's like it kind of bleeds into everything'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think uh this would be done in this way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for example you have talked about the billboard where the advertisement are there so that's the that's a static thing i mean the the model the model actually was hired and he came on the board and he he he got paired and the and he is actually endorsing that item fine one time deal is done but if you talk about the high tech industry and the stores so if you actually apply the same thing here so it means that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'only those people will get a job who are actually having good looks but this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but no nobody's if i have a software house i'm not gonna hire based on your looks i would hire you based on your sort of ability to do certain things and our argument is not that our argument is whether it's OK to sort of hire in certain positions people just based on their looks'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes thirty positions means modeling and the fashion it's fine but if you try to insert'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not even even for the front desk or or the office administration or whatever that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no no for that for that then for that i think we should just leave it like that because there should be some parameters for the molding industry for the movies industry we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but we haven't left it like that now now now they're they're now they're loss against it so we we we have sort of make made it illegal in a lot of sort of states and countries so that's not that's not OK no'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but does does every company does every company not already have like a dress policy where even if you were to work in maybe a laboratory or like any sort of factory the way that you look matters on the principle of you might be the most efficient person but you could get disciplined under your policy if you turn up and unclean clothes or you're not dressed in appropriate fashion for going to work so there's already something that is sort of dictates the way that people look anyway even if it's not to do with attractiveness or whatever that's already in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the company 's policy no matter what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'don't you think it's like some sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at that sort of is morally not so right if if someone is not born with the perfect teams they are they are sort of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but but what i was trying to mean is is like if you're working in like even a shop or a factor that you might be the most efficient person there but if you're turning up in an unkempt manner that's what i mean and is not like that this person 's attracted and you it's more your clothes aren't clean there's maybe a hygiene issue or something like that that would then affect the productiveness of the company itself so that's already there's already an element of it no matter if people trying to escape it or not there's an element of it and everybody's workplace'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'did do you think looks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i mean i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well i think well well i think ninety percent people are really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh love ninety percent people are fine i wanna say they are especially good looking but ninety percent people are fine let me give you this example there are some like i'm from india and there are some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a the singing and dance reality TV shows in initially the when the contestants comes they are really from the village or the urban side i mean they don't have even have those looks but once they all got selected then they go for the grooming session once they are groomed so they go to some beauty parlors and then they have everything set up they're here and and then when they come to the TV we are like wow they are they are so good looking so it means that every person can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if he go if if he gets some kind of training he can be a good looking person so in initially we come to the same point that the person should be hired on the smartest basis and once you get the job this can be groomed but smartness cannot be groomed yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but not everyone is part of a reality TV show nobody is paying for your beauty sessions so well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but nobody 's paying for your education really either i mean i think it it kind of raises a good point like like just as like you have to work to get smart i think you can make an argument that you have to work to look attractive too like to some extent like yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to an extent but but you you can't really be sort of more telling for like a high end fashion brand if you are born with certain genes right so no matter how much you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right yeah i mean there's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's only so much you can do i guess'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's fair'",
        "'speaker_1': 'spent on it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and and and and then to that sort of puts pressure on kids these days especially in this sort of social media'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh sort of era the everyone is getting plastic surgeries and they're putting themselves in harm's way because how the society is generally run and that's because we have made it OK to sort of have those sort of prejudice or like we were more inclined towards having a perfect image as a society and that sort of puts pressure on a lot of kids and it comes with a lot of mental health issues and if we can just take a break and step back and having those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it does yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'more realistic sort of models or images of of people and what what what hours sort of standard of beauty that sort of would would solve that massive issue these days'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean at least around where i live they actually have been doing some like billboards and advertising with like models that don't look like your typical models like there are they are they way more and they like you know just maybe don't like have as they aren't as tall they they just aren't your typical model and they have been using them in advertisements i don't know if you guys have seen that where you live at all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no we have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah yeah yeah we have here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they're quite often in shops there'll be like a sort of plus size model and or something like that but then just to play devil's advocate as well would that not be that somebody 's being hired based on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how do they look'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on their appearance like they're like plus size appearance but yeah it's their appearance nonetheless yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah like to strap it down as essential and appearance based title'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i mean yeah the model the molding industry is actually pushing these things and the people are actually endorsing and they're thinking that this is their own thinking but somehow their TV and the fashion industry are actually putting these thoughts into their mind and then these kind of models'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i give you one example of india what angela is there at i think he can he can give us more insights into it so for example in in india or south asia because it was an english colony so we had this sort of mental scarring of being sort of under that influence or like inferiority complex of being white because we were ruled by white people so the standard of the beauty has become white and subconsciously and we and we're not supposed to be white we are supposed to be brown or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'black brown or whatever he hates of some brown and then now people are selling those whitening creams and it's horrifying the stuff that it does so and and bollywood and they're sort of media has played its part to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly exactly even even even even when the parents go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly exactly exactly even even in my city it is even in my city it is popular that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah in in my city when the parents they are looking for the bride for the groom the their first party is that the skin should be white collar fair skin'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so what do you guys think about this social conditioning by the media and doesn't it have a responsibility to sort of set more realistic or like break those stereotypes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i mean i think it as important that the there's not it's not just going to conform to like one individual look because you know considering the number of races in this necessities that look entirely different from each other who have different complexions and different facial features or even different characteristics genetically it's important that there's a spread at least then i mean in terms of you know hiring someone on the way they look that's absolutely fine if it's going to be there's at least a representation of you know the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well i'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then it will population as a whole not just one white person who's tall and thin with blonde hair and white teeth that you know that not because not everyone can look like that and trying to get everyone to like that would just be ridiculous'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right and i think like in like i think it's a at least here in the united states it's illegal like if you can't like not hire someone based on their rates so you could i guess maybe there's some people who like claim their ohh it's their appearance but if it's the color of their skin then you're not hiring them on based on their race which is like illegal so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now i think i think all told you have laws against hiring not hiring people based on looks as well so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'oh is is that true'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes and then i i i i yeah in the US yeah so i i think in most countries this illegal to i i'm i mean the developed countries i'm talking about like yeah in scandinavia you cannot get away with it so if there is enough evidence that you have sort of not hired someone based on their looks so there's that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i don't know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in this country'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i suppose it would be a very hard and it would be very rude that you list of someone tried to do that and just get away with it and say well i didn't like the look of that person 's face but then for example if you turned up if you're a smart person you turn up to an interview and like you know a pair of shorts and a vest they probably wouldn't hire you because of the way that you looked in that that would be deemed as more acceptable way of turning something down if you know i mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right i think it would be really kind kind of hard to prove like like i cause a you know somebody 's gonna lie and say like ohh why didn't hire them for some other reason and how do you prove it you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but don't you guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah but but in the US like it's a you don't need much sort of evidence to take someone to court'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so yeah there there is that for sure for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'unfortunately this is happening that in the interview'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there there have been some instances where the guys when they went for the IT interview especially those smart jerks so they were actually giving like they were trying hard to get into the company but on the other hand when they're smart and beautiful and tall girl with no ID with no ID'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh like those answers and nothing she just went inside with a smile and she got selected because the the the the higher manager thing that she might be a good fit for the company to bring some glamour so the these things are going on unfortunately and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but that's your perception you don't know maybe someone who's good looking or who's like the really well put together they could be smart as well they they could do the job so why why why should we have that sort of notion that they got the job because they're good looking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no no see this is not happened for one time like these kind of cases i've been hearing for maybe like like five or six years and there are people who the guy specially they complain that we did really well in the academics and unfortunately because of one of those one or two mistakes we could not be selected but look at the the smart girl who was so glamorized and when she got selected and now what she's doing she's going to hawaii and so on and so forth places'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i know her i know her ID knowledge because she was just an average incident so the hiring manager just did not ask those tough questions because he or she knew that she as a she is a good looking girl so so you know to bring glamour you know this is are going on yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well what about this what about if there's like two like say there's a job opening and there's two applicants and they're both like equally smart they went to good schools and they're both smart but ones like prettier than the other they like offer this yeah this offer one thing that the other person doesn't like i mean what do you do in that case'",
        "'speaker_1': 'matthew simon'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i i see where it's going yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what's that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah so what what what would you do simon'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean so i think that honestly if they were otherwise equal i might go with the one that was more attractive and i do think it happens because like there's some some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'why why is that why is that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i you know but i mean i i don't know i guess like it's just like appearance is valued by society you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is is it conscious'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is it conscious or it's it's it's uh sort of unconscious stereotypes that we sort of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'probably unconscious probably unconscious like i wouldn't be like plant planning to her'",
        "'speaker_3': 'rather than unconscious passion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'did did you you guys think that that we have certain stereotypes as much as we sort of talk about not having it we do have those and we we do sort of lean towards certain sort of type of people or individuals i can give you an example for example like i'm part of like a minority here and like yeah i do have those two types as well and i i'll i'll be more comfortable with a certain ethnicity and certain background with a certain accent and like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not consciously unconsciously i'll be more sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'inclined to believe but they're saying then as sort of another sort of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is that is that not just like just general human nature where you know people will be more unconsciously biased to people who look and sound and think like them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah i think i think we are doomed as a species like that's how we sort of operate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more often than not like and not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's unfortunate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i suppose it's like a you know how many thousands of year old thing where you know if you're in some tribe somewhere and someone who looks like you're you know that they are you know they're not a threat to you because they one of your own whereas if someone completely different comes in then you know the one thing is to think they come in to try and steal what is main it's just something that sort of hard wired them to people which these days is very very hard to shake off but it's still there it would be wrong to say it's not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you guys get into certain situations where you have to check yourself because i find myself in certain situations where i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i try to be consistent as much as i can but i there there were every now then i will have to check myself and give everyone their due respect and which i would be unconsciously not giving them or not giving them the attention just because of the way they're speaking it could be because of their accent or whatever i just just and if someone is like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that is reasonable though as as long as you're actually having to stop yourself and say this isn't right then that's fine because people fall into that trap all the time as long as you're not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consistently acting on it then that's fine'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two men'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well simon actually talk about two things sorry one thing but she gave an example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's not simon'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's something that's OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'simon simon OK OK OK simon simon she said that if there are two candidates with equal marks and equal academics so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'better'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and they'll have who would you hire someone good looking or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the someone who was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh well before answering this question i i should rather say that when if i pick the smart person the good the good looking person i won't call it as a stereotype why because when my other parameters are are getting fulfilled meaning the smartness are there the good marks are there the good academics are there and i feel that this candidate going to be a good asset for my company then there should be one exception meter which is the appearance OK fine i can take it but but but if the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but both are dressed equally well everything is the same the only difference is what one is slightly more good looking and the other person is not so good looking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but but but but in terms of but in terms of appearance the weightage are still with the candidate candidate number one but if these'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who was that the good looking one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah that yeah good looking one but in the but in in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but why is that well how is it gonna help you in your company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see i mean when the when the village when the village are completely same then there should be some parameter OK fine this person is actually getting one extra point for their appearance then i'll go for that why would i hire'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's an IT company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'nobody but people should get points for something that it's useful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like like like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean maybe it's not maybe it's not really fair cause like in real life like i don't really know if two people would be exactly equal other than their appearance there's probably something else that's different about them so maybe it's not even like a fair statement'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then it comes out naturally because if you see a flower you will say wow because it comes out naturally you human being go for that good looking thing either a person or a thing or a object so it's a natural thing it's a it's a natural phenomena'",

        "'speaker_3': 'so and and may well be that you know all the person is more the person who's a good looking might be slightly more sort of stuck up or stubborn because they're used to having everyone sort of falling over on them because they're very good looking whereas the the less good looking person might well be more reasonable more sort of easygoing more easy to negotiate with or hang about with because they've not had the same sort of privilege as a good looking person might have in society'",

        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then you're more likely to trust us'",

        "'speaker_4': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well one thing i was just thinking when you guys were talking about the politics is that like a lot of politicians are older right so when you talk about like by and large politicians aren't super attractive it's i think like in part because they're like all like sort of older people you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'looking at byron i think there should be an upper threshold as well like you don't want that either'",

        "'speaker_1': 'no no no adjustments here for these feeds go for it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but anyway i think that like youth and beauty kind of go together right like usually like i mean you can have good looking like older people but like like they look well for their age or whatever and so then that kind of gets'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i think a lot of people would prefer a lot of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sort of middle aged white guys like josh looney is a perfect example or'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i have a very sexist theory on it so this is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's a slippery slope i think for guys it's different i think guys can sort of the more they sort of age like they they sort of so we we mature later for for women i think it's the opposite once you hit four days it's just downhill'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i think that's true cause cause like you know like if a a man gets like gray hair around the temples or something like that that's kind of like ohh it like adds character but like like a woman it's kind of like go get your hair dyed like so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there was a study i was looking at and it was of the differences between males and females and and what they find most attractive so it's like a it was a graph of sort of like the increase in the age of the man and the increase of the age of the women and the women 's graph it was the sort of aligned the most attractive age to what the age that they were so the older they got the sort of older the person that was they were attracted to it and the males one it sort of went up and peaked at about twenty five and stayed at twenty five no matter the age of the man afterwards'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it's like the the sort of perception of beautiful women is like like well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'until when'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what's our threshold'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that lets you just state so it was like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but when when when it started to drop'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it doesn't it just plateaued'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the platform is twenty five and stayed there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK that's that's that's a good news then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so like so it was like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so so like no it was like so even so for what men found attractive in women was the sort of average age would be twenty five and that's stayed there from when they were twenty five until they were eighty whereas women found men most attractive in it sort of increased'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as they any age as they got older if you know what i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'got it got it and i think it has to do more with the our our sort of natural inclination i don't know if it's social conditioning or we are born with this i think men are more so for facial in the way they sort of select their partners at least i am like i'm i'm more sort of worried about the way she looks then her personality but for women i think it's it's more than just the looks if like it's it's it's a very smaller part of the whole equation than for guys for us like looks are like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah they definitely are yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'eighty percent or seventy percent depending on how shallow we are or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean i i mean i i would agree with that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but for women i think there's there's a lot more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tim and would you agree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah i was just gonna say i was gonna agree with that and i was just saying that i wonder if it's because like historically you know the men take this like caretaker role in the family so like maybe maybe you like if you're smart woman you don't want just somebody who's like good looking you want him to be able to like go out and have a good job and like you know fix stuff around the house or whatever so you're looking like as a practical matter for more than just the looks you know i don't know i don't know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i i think it has to do a lot with our history as well because back in the stone age or like growing up in those sort of ancient times we didn't have those are bugs control or like women were not so empowered or like did they they won't able to sort of survive on their own because of so monthly stuff and because we didn't have the hygiene or like like those tampons or anything like that and that came in like in couple of centuries back so i i think they were a lot more dependent on men so they were looking for more than just a pretty face'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'when when i think it comes it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but i but i think it comes with the maturity i mean there are some girls who are eighteen nineteen and they go for the guys who go for the wheely and you know who go for the bike racing but there are some girls who are twenty five twenty six and they and they go for the smart and good earning guy who can take care of the family so i think just the maturity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no there are two things one is like hooking up or like having a casual sort of fling and and it's a whole other thing when you're looking for a relationship i i think girls tend to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sort of choose the guys more wisely than men sort of vice versa'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i agree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as the old stereotype of like this sort of very pretty girl who goes for the sort of sort of like semi good looking sort of boarding and reliable man because it's more of like a it's like a reasonably safe choice whereas the guy is going for just like the really good looking girl who is probably highly strung or like does that stereotype that the women is actually making a very good choice in partner and the guy is just choosing to go because she's good looking'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'simon would you like to enlighten us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'simon'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so you're asking if they like like you think like people factor in the social status or whatever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no the the the there's there's this thought in in sort of a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sort of a lot of intellects like they talk about it that the women have hypogamy so they they would date someone who's slightly higher in social hierarchy than them so they won't take down most of the times'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh i see ohm yeah i don't know because maybe like you're worried about what like i feel like women talk to other women about the people they're dating a lot like they like the girls talk about it so i i wonder if you like date down or whatever if then like you'd be embarrassed about what your friends would think or something like that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i'm not really sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'maybe it was a more traditional traditional sense like when it was more you wouldn't date down when you were the only sole earner of the household was the man so then you would essentially be putting yourself in a worse situation like maybe a hundred years ago it was very important whereas nowadays not so much'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'matthew would you be comfortable if if if your if your partner is running a lot more than you would you be comfortable in that sort of a relationship or would you prefer someone'",

        "'speaker_2': 'uh'",
