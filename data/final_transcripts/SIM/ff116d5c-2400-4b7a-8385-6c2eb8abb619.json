        "'speaker_4': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i'm in my opinion like i'm from germany right and we have a minimum wage and the minimum wage covers the basic living costs and it works we don't have any homeless people if i look in the US if i see the amount of homeless people i think something is going wrong'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like you'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and also said they're getting now they have a job where they can take care of the family but when you consider around on welfare all day long why get a job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but that's the thing we have to do in germany too right you can live off health care but people people are want to work people are going to work of course you always have people who don't want to work but it's better to have them in a in a house and eating food and having him on the streets it's even cheaper for the economy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK like let me just tell you the last time it was revised was two thousand fifteen OK the two thousand fifteen i think it was like seven years back it was revised you see the inflation is skyrocketing OK it is right now it nine or ten percent per year OK it is increasing daily but the minimum cost is the same which has been from the last decade i think OK i didn't know when it was revised OK so the average american family is like they don't have you in the grocery costs they are like eating burgers and all things they didn't have money to buy the veggies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do you believe that if we have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to their children or something OK so it is like a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so if the minimum wage raises and we pay people more to help other people work at their their places and facilities and keep them clean and going do do you believe that things like health care should be more expensive and that's not that that's not really the focus of this question but how i should really reward that is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm thinking things like that the health care rising and lowering for people that actually have to pay that themselves i can't really look at it to where we would pay that person more and expect them to pay health care more i would expect them to be doing better things with that extra amount of money that was given versus damaging themselves just to pay for that much more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK there's also one point like you can increase consumer spending also with that there is a study like i have read few years back that the person who is earning a low wage earners OK they will put everything back into the economy OK like they will purchase food clothing transportation shelter and other things they will invest everything in the necessity OK they will not be like holding money in their backyards OK they will not be like billionaires who have billions of dollars sitting somewhere idle in a foreign country OK they'll put them back into that OK you can have a CEO salaries like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we would hope so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'five million dollars OK and someone who is doing a job he's not able to even offer food to his children so that is a serious disparity over here OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would you what are we OK so if you you wanna give equal outcomes so everybody should make the same amount of money no that's at least the united states that's not the way it is we have it's a capitalist society if you do well you get compensated and you move up and everybody has the same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but you don't have to compensate it like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there and take that job cleaning toilets forever you'll say hey i think i want a better job go down the street and say hey i've been cleaning toilets from the best toilet cleaner in the whole city and i wanna job cleaning your building and now i'm cleaning your building and so you can do all sorts of things'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but robert now i have a question for you like i mean you have you have you have a certain amount of jobs like deep cleaning collets getting the garbage which you need right it's not like if if everybody would study nobody would do it our society would fall apart but shouldn't should shouldn't those people and i mean if for like for example a garbage man i know garbage men who are really working hard right it's a hard working job it's not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's right'",

        "'speaker_3': 'well here in germany you're making minimum wage if you do that job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's the'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK that is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i i get what you're saying but they work themselves up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that the signal but the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the the thing is if if you do a normal job like let's say a ground job where you shouldn't earn minimum wage why wanna why not why shouldn't those people be able also to have like a normal life why should there be under the poverty line what's the what's the thing about this cleaning tool and that's bad'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we'll see'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you gotta pay your dues you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'nothing wrong cleaning toilets which you become better at it and go get a job cleaning the building and then then owning the building you keep working your way up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'by who placed the toilet then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the thing is that like let me point you the person who who is working that OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who cleans the toilet then if the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so when the person'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the new guy coming in the new guy comes in and cleans the toilet'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where the new guy has a masters in in in in in some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no he doesn't no he doesn't that's bullshit the the guy that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's not the way we do things here in the united states the new person comes in as an entry level employee and he he gets taught how the clean the toilet just like the person before him clean the toilet then he works his way up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and he puts in his proposals just the way the same person did and he earns his living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and he goes applies for another job that's paying more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where what rabbit but robert said'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what was the world that's is saying robert is saying that everybody should get an education and if you have an education you you're not bored'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they all have the opportunity or that maybe an education just learn how to be the best toilet cleaner so i can go to the guy down the street and say i want a job at your place doing clean the whole building and and the guy all right i'll give you a shot at that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'where you're not going to study you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if everybody were to study nobody would clean the toilets that's my point'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'll also like if he says that germany is a load of they pay low low wages for the essential workers that do those types of what we call low jobs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'let us let us rotate one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it would all always probably help if the the people that are sticking to those jobs getting paid the least are are they sharing with people how to clean the toilets or like are they coming up with ideas like hey my possibly we could put like an extra'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so an extra set of wipes in the bathroom so people that don't want to use a dirty bathroom don't have to and then you don't have to realize that people are just dirtying it up because they consider that a low level job that's not really teaching even our younger people how to to perform hygiene on themselves or their surroundings'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK there is there is only one argument which works here in case of favor of that that rating minimum wage will kill jobs this is what we can understand there are like small businesses who can't afford to pay if they're the minimum wage is increased they have to close their shops and intern it will kill jobs this is the only'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's right now no nobody can buy that use that service had to close the shop and now he's out of work and he doesn't have any money so now what do you do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'uh i thought now that is the only argument which works in their favor OK but the USA has a ton of money for welfare they can have a ton of money for things and there's like you can see that the there is also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that's a i agree there was a whole that's a different whole different argument we should quit paying all this welfare and people would work that jobs clean the toilet for a couple of weeks while they got better in the went down the street to learn to do something higher paying but when as long as we're paying all this welfare it has no incentive for anybody to go to work'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK like see the many like why raising is the right thing to do OK like wage growth is directly going to the highest or not OK they are earning more and more and the lower incomes are earning less and less every day you can see that disparity there is a ton of disparity you can see there are some communities where which are on the bottom of the social chain OK they're neighborhoods are bad there is a ton of crimes OK because there is no income to support their families OK if they have income in there they can move out of the social bracket'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK they can also increasing that also if a company is paying if a company has a ton of money OK did we say our different company like microsoft or someone who have a ton of money at their hand and they're not paying well to their employees it is very bad for the scenario'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it just because you have a ton of money doesn't mean at least in our capitalist society just cause the company is making a ton of money doesn't mean he should give it to an employee who is not producing anything cleaning a toilet is only worth so much now the guy that's out in front selling things making money for the company is is more value added to the company you can't pay the two the same because there's value the value to the company is not the same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but he has to have a like a person is cleaning it on it let me suggest this is the only example you are taking on let me just tell you on that OK if a person is cleaning the toilet he has to have their family address needs that rest OK if you have no one like no one will clean the toilet OK you have to yourself the person who is having the most amount of money will have to clean their toilet themselves OK because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'he did it's not made to be to meet the families need'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i've actually known people that i've done janitorial services that i have no family to take care of what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but why'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no one is well to clean that all because they are not getting the wages defined OK if you don't have the person for that he's also a very important person you can't deny his existence OK like you can't deny him that he's the he's doing a menial job OK but he's a menial job is very important for that because you can't do that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is very important OK the person who is connecting you always say it's very important to that if he strikes for one day you can see the how the state of the toilets are in public areas where there is no toilet cleaner OK you can't deny there existence OK so they need to have some amount of money if you're companies earning tons and tons of money the CEO is getting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's a it's an it's it's an it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK sir so prashant if they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it doesn't matter what the company is making the value of that job is only a certain amount i don't care if the how much the company is making it doesn't mean they have to pay the toilet paper or the the cleaner the same as the guy that's bringing in millions of dollars for the company they are they have different values'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not to to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes of course but you set the value has been minimum and not worth of earning a living and this is something i don't understand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but he'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's it it's not meant for a living wage it's not meant for a living wage it's an introductory level job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if it's one person that i have to replace the toilet'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how why why he can't live with family or by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'why why why should'",
        "'speaker_3': 'why why is you you're saying it's not meant for a living life in germany it is and it works'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well it's not in the united states'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but the question is ethically why'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for a person cleaning the toilets'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we don't we don't pay the toilet cleaner the same as we do a college graduate period'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's why you have that's that's why you have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of course you shouldn't but i'm not saying i'm not i'm but why shouldn't should'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK let me just tell you OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's no minimum wage for restaurant owners OK let me just tell you in another different example not totally different scene OK there is a no like no minimum wage for restaurant owners OK what they are getting they're getting nothing OK like if there are surviving on the benefit of the consumers that eat there you have to every time calculate like whether ten percent is good whether fifteen percent of the tip is good where twenty percent of the tip is good for everyone OK like you can see that why because they're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is gratuity and that is based on how you're treated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right there's nothing to do with the company how much you're gonna pay'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what their employees of their that particular organization they have to the restaurants are running turn off money why can't they pay their employees why do why they have to leave on my mercies OK like how much i'm able to tip them OK if i'm not i don't want to tip them OK how will they survive'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it because that's the way it is if they didn't they knew that when they took that job they could have went down the street and got a different job'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but there has to be some something like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but it but it is it is it is a job as a waiter they can be the very best waiter in that whole in that whole restaurant and they're gonna get paid more than the rest of them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because they worked hard that's the same thing as being the best'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah if you go around the if you go around once'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but it depends on the person of if a person if they give their best service OK they are the best writers in the country OK like period but if i am the person who is sitting there i'm not the best person in the country i don't want to give a single type i will tip them one dollar OK my standard is one dollar'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know let's not let's not fair maybe the next guy will pay you there's a guy in omaha just got a five thousand dollar tip'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a perfect explanation for this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK but why should it be dependent on the guys mercy OK like the next guy will pay why should their living expenses depending on the next guys if the next guy is good or not OK like you i have seen a ton of youtube videos where'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what what are you saying we should pay everybody pay everybody what the owner makes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK i can tell you why that person is the person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that person is expected'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what what that person is expected to'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK like see that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's why you're supposed to pay people we're too idiot tips and if you go around town giving one dollar tips you have to realize that persons family probably lives in that town so when you go down the street and you're getting treated like you're working with the dollar that's because you now are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but why should it be dependent on their mercy like why don't you why should the organization the restaurant owner'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well whose mercy should it be to be on the the the shop owners have the shop owners say hey i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna pay you more than me because i want you you're you're you're you don't know anything and you're not bringing any very little value'",
