        "'speaker_2': 'you know locked down your social media profile if there are companies who absolutely have to see it and it's something you you know it's the job that you really want then here let's rework it and we will go through and we will change everything on that profile to match what that company is looking for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have another scenario say there's a say there's a a starting at there's an artist that's just starting not starting out but they they're struggling artists that's that's a massively known phrase have a struggling artist'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's applying for a position at a job and already knowing that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're going to use the funds from that job to take care of themselves pay their bills take care of their home and hoping that they make enough to actually buy equipment for their own artistry so they can do their own thing with that also you have to keep in mind that if you have a certain type of artist for instance for me i might decide to advocate for people with depression some of my art isn't gonna be for people that don't have problems with depression i might draw a picture i might talk to someone and they're like every single day when i wake up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that feels like i'm drowning in a lake i can't breathe it feels like there's bubbles coming out of my nose i might draw a picture of someone drowning in a lake now my employer might be like that's disturbing i didn't like that you did that you're fired when all i was actually doing was advocating for someone else i drew a picture of it because i'm an artist and it actually helped them tremendously and that only brings it back to one person that that actually ends up not caring about people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but to me the whole concept is strange because he in germany it's illegal that an employer looks at your private social media profile because as i said like we yeah yeah we we we had some privacy laws coming through three years five years and seven years ago which kind of puts your own private data not just do social media profile but even your private data and the internet above everything else and if anybody wants to access this for example if you go into your new site and somebody wants to look at your cookies you need to give consent for it and if you don't it's illegal'",

        "'speaker_3': 'ask you to accept it you can sue them U M and uh you get money for it and yeah it's it's because i mean it's that's in my opinion that's how it should be so i am i don't understand why you and you also have this this big problem where they don't do the same privacy laws that we have here in in germany because it it works really well and i think everybody 's comfortable with that also i mean the employer cancel said can look at your public social media profile but they should never be allowed to look at your private social media profile'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so so i think it goes on to the thing though are you making it public or private cause if you make your social media private public i think you just have to deal with the consequences of that if we're being brutally honest if you if you don't want to deal with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i mean i think at that point that's on you yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just yeah i know it's on your you just need to make a private thing about in that scenario just'"
