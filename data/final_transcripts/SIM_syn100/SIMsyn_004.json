        "'speaker_1': 'i'm i'm correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if if see if it is human who will be benefited then the test should be done on the human if animal is if if the animal will be benefited then do the test on the animal if human has to be if the ultimate beneficiary is a human being then the test must also be done on the human being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but then do you not realize that it carries a huge risk with itself like what if it's what if it's literally poison so for example there ten volunteers who come in into a drug trial right we give them this vaccine which is poisonous and it and it carries with itself or virus that is that that that literally eradicate the human population which is even worse than covid nineteen they go and spread it out to a thousand other people and the thousand other people go out spread it to a million more people so just think of it like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's the way it how what happens'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like that that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes that is true but then the the manufacturer uh has to be more responsible before before giving that test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but you know in in the way we were actually that's what we are talking about about the responsibility and the responsibility of of what part like there there are researchers in one way there is a public there is a government there is some international organizations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the best'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this is the test'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but also with research right like how how would they know that's the thing like they have tried their best to make a chemical they don't know how it's gonna react in our body that's that's the problem'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who do you think OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah that that's a'",

        "'speaker_2': 'that is the problem but that is also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when it comes to when it comes to the point where the drawing to when it comes to the point where they're going to inject an animal i believe that has become the least restrictive thing they can do i believe they've already done their computer simulations they've done everything that they can and the only way to assure at that last step that everything is as it seems in the computer simulations is to try it on something and your suggestion of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is that is a problem'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know if it's for a human you should try it on the human i'm i don't know i mean i i i respect it i think it's a legitimate point of view in the world but i just don't i see it as a minority opinion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah no same same yeah to be fair'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it yeah did do you think guys that in general we should kind of move the development of the humankind in many ways like do you think we should kind of cut down on the animal testing and decrease amount of that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'since we have been other abilities'"
