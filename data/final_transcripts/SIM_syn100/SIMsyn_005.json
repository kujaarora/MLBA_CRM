        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the resume or CV board are the same OK so let me tell you what what is the difference actually like see first thing you have to actually find out what the candidate candidates studies are what was his experience that does that can be written only in the CSV then we have to see whether this person is like he has written he can speak this language he has this knowledge then that can happen only when we call and speak to that person so we we then we fix up a telephonic then we fix up a telephonic round'",

        "'speaker_3': 'no see see see you you talk about the you talk about the knowing the person so this could be done through the video call not through the linkedin but you are actually pushing the linkedin or facebook profile but at the but at the end you are somewhere also inclined towards the whole the the the main point which is that the we should the embryo should do the person the right candidate and this should be done through the interaction through the video or voice call so why we are discussing about the linkedin'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of course there is everybody does that if you are being selected OK consider your answer you are being selected for a job like say with HCL they don't call you right away OK they send you an they send you a mail stating that we had we have your profile over here and we would like to fix up a telephonic round with you OK so so'",
