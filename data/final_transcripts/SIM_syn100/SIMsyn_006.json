        "'speaker_3': 'well my question is if we if we make a client with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i mean yeah cause you could just make another person i mean so yeah why would you test on the animals after that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK but if we make a clone without'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a brain and we're testing for like stroke victims and stuff that's not something that we can do if it if the animal or person or the animal doesn't have a brain'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but the thing there is if that if we were to do something like that so let me just use me as an example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the one time like that i'm living to mars'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like if if i'm gonna use me so i don't put anybody else in a bad situation hopefully not putting myself in a bad situation either but if i knew that say i had some type of disease or syndrome'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that they needed help figuring things out about it they cloned me and made a version of me without a brain i would then think about everything i've ever done what might have made me sick and i would go they're gonna find that when they open up that version of me'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a brain'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what is about to happen'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah OK i can see that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'and and my for for me if that were to happen i'd be OK because i'm like yep i did that that's in there i do that on a regular whoops that's what happened i'll stop now some people are gonna be like well now i have to kill the doctor because they know what i've been doing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean'",
        "'speaker_3': 'look at look at our look at our country and just and i'm gonna go back to the bird flu we've had such a bad breakout of bird of the bird flu is it OK to test the the chickens and stuff to make sure that they don't have it and to figure out why they have it if they do have it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i'm clueless about that i raised chickens as a child and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'still to this day i'm almost thirty years old and i tell myself i'm not all the time sometimes i get real and tell myself what happened but on a regular i still go with the fact because it would hurt me inside i go with the fact of no my family said the the woods monster got it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like we'd go outside and there's like feathers everywhere i believe we probably ate it but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so somebody says somehow our chickens and our turkeys and stuff got the avian bird flu it killed millions of them that's why our egg prices have gone up so much and other things and like chicken and stuff and why they also said that turkeys were hard to find over the over the holidays but it did it was in the country it did kill millions of them and it's like to me it's OK to test the other birds to make sure they don't have it and also too if they do find one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to figure out how to control it so that we don't have a situation like this again where millions of our chickens and turkeys and ducks and everything are getting killed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well yeah there's nothing wrong with testing it testing because i mean we do it on humans we test to see if you you know like the covid you get tested to see if you have it and stuff so there's nothing wrong with like the like that you know testing at all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because if the if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you could you could also justify that at the end you at the end of animal testing you always need a human test subject to come to like start verifying the medicine actually works so you could argue that you could just skip the angle to this and go straight to human testing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but that that that's but that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the mortician'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in any given place is doing'",

        "'speaker_3': 'why'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you mean like the autopsies and stuff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right like if we're doing autopsies we should be those those people might have families like can you go in there and find out what the heck is wrong with their grandkid before we have to splice an animal up for it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well like my daughter is a nurse and the school she picked was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'had the only cadaver lab for freshman nursing and so she was able to go into bodies and stuff right away but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think it's a little bit different too is eighties bodies were donated to science B they're very respectful of these bodies by keeping the faces covered and stuff so you've never look at the person 's face unless you're doing something on it but it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'said that there's a whole different line of respect for something like that than an animal that we just grab and stick a needle in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'my yeah because i mean this is also the cadaver lab the people have you know like you said they they've you know consented to you know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be you know to be looked at and and look and see what what is in the body and stuff like that or what you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean if an animal looked at me'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to find out about some disease they had or what you know tumor or or whatever to help and that does help i mean you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to find out'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i mean i'm not going to do it if an animal looked at me and said OK you can do it i'm running the other way'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i'm like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well i'm one to but and i could be completely vulnerable and gullible with this this is where i will mention the monkeys i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm because i'm i i love the zoo i like going to the zoo'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm i have a fairly good relationship with the'",

        "'speaker_2': 'just like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i have a fairly good related they wouldn't think i have a good relationship with them if they heard me say that but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh summer silverbacks or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'silverback that's what i was thinking'",

        "'speaker_3': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but with those those silverbacks if that were to happen i would want like if say it it did something and it got a broken arm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i'm pretty sure it's seen people this whole time with casts coming to the to the zoo because if my child had a broken arm i might be like you know let's go to the zoo you had a rough day when i maybe the next day or something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",

        "'speaker_3': 'this is one aspect OK which the AI has not yet reached OK it is i think it is never going to reach that level OK like within our lifetimes OK so that it can do that OK but there's there will be some guidelines the USA as one of the pinnacles of technical advancement they have a great team there they will have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but would you say there's a lot of different ways of hurting people like let's say you're using a celebrity you're using AI to to you know to fake that they're there are some celebrity doesn't that hurt them it can hurt their career'",
