        "'speaker_4': 'or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah frogs are definitely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i know and and some of them uh i'm not sure what the like some they'll use you know after they've after they've died so that the live testing that sure exactly a full list animals but it's funny you mentioned with the pets i was just thinking like guinea pigs popped in my head because yeah that's kind of like a saying like i'll be you'll be my guinea pig for this test this but i don't hear about guinea pigs being tested on anymore i wonder if it's because people started having them as pets'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i think uh yeah i think people started having this pets and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i guess like less testing maybe happens on i'm not sure'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes you are saying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no you know you know i was i was saying that you know the the closer the animal is to human the more they get used for experiments you know i mean closer in terms of the like the logical like the biology like the way they are the genes and and also the health problems that they get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'had a really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and this one yeah that's why the mice uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'very what like they used to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot more than others because of that like the the similarities with humans so probably probably the guinea pig is the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'you know the other thing i was thinking is that we use animals for testing that you know medicines and like mostly industrial medicine'",

        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah herb herb herbal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like this you know the the natural things and we can use those to'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes but most of the heart'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that's that's when the economics come in it's definitely tougher to sell cause like we can go to the grocery store and get ginger for cheap and if if if you find out it's just that's some all natural things you can just go get then they can't sell you fifty dollars a pill'",
        "'speaker_3': 'eggs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's because'",

        "'speaker_4': 'that could'",

        "'speaker_3': 'and and that's where the conflict of interest is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think we're all in agreement that yeah like cosmetics things that aren't i guess medical related or potential like breakthroughs for helping humans that the that those are not and and do those and that's not some i didn't look up did those does that happen much anymore i know it's a big thing obviously the man i don't know much about the makeups and all that so it is that i know there's their branding like animal cruelty free and all that so is that is there still testing on animals for cosmetics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like absolutely necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that i i believe there is a company that released the the abandoned complete they completely abandoned'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm making cosmetics like like testing their cosmetics on animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i believe they they give a statement i i will search and and and send to you in a chat quickly but i remember i saw that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but but you know from from the end you know everyone is finding a niche you know like if they stop doing the animal testing what everyone else is doing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's also it's it's a business uh so it's a business opportunity or it it gives them a name and like it's a brand so so they use they used it more of like a brand not not a commitment because they are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they just use the opportunity because the animal activists they have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on them like why are you using animals just for cosmetics and so they took that opportunity you know to make a brand out of it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then you think oh that's a nice company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah in some of those companies they might test on animals for half of their stuff and not on the other half and they're doing a marketing campaign talking about these products are not animal testing'",

        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i just found something it says'",

        "'speaker_1': 'wow'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so it says animals'",
        "'speaker_4': 'testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'used for medicine in the US and then cosmetics and china animals are used'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i wonder i mean it's just a difference of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh too many of you know whether after the test being done are the animals safe or do it it hampers their life lifetime'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm i mean that's a very good question i'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah you know some of them not only tempering some of them die some of them permanent damage'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some of that's right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and and then and those are majorities like dying and and permanent damage is majority very few you know at the end of maybe success'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when they are successful in finding the the medicine probably and that's very rare those final ones will will'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because you need a lot of i mean even if you make basic medicines it might need a lot of animals to test because to be successful you need a lot of trials right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm and the L ones usual die and the middle ones that come on in damage and then the last one probably will survive'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so like every other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the the last one the last prototype will be the one that we supply to the market so before that every other animal might get pampered yes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'most'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and it's not just a minor hamper it might'",

        "'speaker_2': 'is it OK i guess and then that goes back to the question is it OK for companies if they feel like you know a good percentage of our customers are men this is gonna help us with profits so we wanna hire more attractive people maybe maybe we only wanna hire females in that position instead of males at what point i guess do we cross the is that line crossed into the that's that shouldn't be allowed'",

        "'speaker_2': 'sexual orientation i think it's in you know some places religion so you know should there be anything that is put in place to try to make sure companies aren't hiring just off of appearance is it certain industries that there's there should be something in place so that doesn't happen'",
