        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK internship doesn't quite guarantee of a job where internship period is over you have to find another job or internship'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes but we have the option and the opportunity potentially to work where you did your internship most places that offer internship well i won't say most i don't know if that's statistically correct or accurate but i would say in my experience with because i am i have my doctorate degree and i had to do internships you have opportunities throughout the course of your education or post education to be offered jobs in so many cases by the places where you go to do the internship so i think the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the benefit that you're gaining'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it should it it it balances out as far as compensation is concerned because even if you don't get a job at that particular company you now have that skill set you can add those qualifications and skills to your resume as well as the length of time on your resume of how long you did the internship because that adds and is considered as previous experience as shadra mentioned many companies want you to have hands on you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'experience doing whatever it is that you're applying for and so again i state making that practice illegal really lessens the opportunities for so many people in the workforce who need as many opportunities as possible especially with inflation going on it's so much harder to find jobs as it is taking away one particular component of preparation for that job because let's say it's illegal and so you don't you don't have the opportunities to do internships'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as as it were they have to be paid so again like i was saying if you were companies are going to be able to do it because not everybody can afford to pay their interns and then the the job pool and the job market is significantly infected infected affected because they're not that many people who can apply for the jobs out there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i agree and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but how do you how do you how do you deal with the with the companies that there are kinda abusing that system so so so perhaps a company doesn't need more truly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'qualified workers but but they need workers who who just gonna do the i don't know the the the easy tasks but but there is still need to be done and they abuse the internship system by by hiring interns that are not getting paid but are doing those tasks for them so how do you deal with that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think uh government regulation the US department of labor as i was speaking of before has certain restrictions and parameters the number of hours someone can work the type of environment that they can work in so you could not have an intern working like an on construction site operating certain kind of machinery or what have you if they have not done an apprenticeship and they've done that in a controlled environment you know so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the UM i i think i guess regulating what exactly the intern can do when where and for how many hours and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and and forcing that by maybe not allowing any tax incentives you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any any kind of benefits that the company would gain would be affected or they could be punished through some kind of remuneration if they do not abide by those guidelines that are set for their internship programs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and also before choosing your internship it's very well mentioned in the job description if the internship is legit and the company is good so it's very well mentioned in the job description like what your responsibilities would be and what you will be doing in that particular role and also we signed the internship contract before joining in right so we do have a legal side or legal proof of what we were supposed to do and what the companies making us do so we can always take a stand on that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but sometimes there are so many frauds regarding internship or job positions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what can you say about shraddha'",
        "'speaker_3': 'say that again please'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can always verify before joining it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my internship and the positions'",
        "'speaker_2': 'enter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people can say you have to pay this much amount and you will get an internship or full-time or best internship you will get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i would rather do online courses than if i have to pay i ain't doing that but again there are many options where you can go for good legit companies rather than going for such scams where you yourself have to pay to the company to hire you as an intern'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but you are have no idea about the social steps what were you doing then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you can you repeat'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can you repeat i couldn't hear you properly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i said there is so many fraud regarding job and internship we are fresh and we have no experience regarding a full step regarding get untouchable interview what we can should be an interview what we don't should interview'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK yeah i feel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it was my college who took a front state where they educated us on how to check if the company is legit and if they're offering you a good deal so i feel that's totally up to us if you could go a bit into detail check the registration check if the company is really good and if it's really registered and checked the reviews on glassdoor you can always have that option where previous employees are ex employees have mentioned their reviews if the work culture is good if the company is good'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they treat their employees good so these are some factors which you should consider even while choosing an internship and not just your job which can again save you from the frauds and scams that are happening in the market'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly i think i think that it gives you an opportunity to start practicing some of those job searching skills that you're going to need once you graduate and enter the market and again let's remember it's not it's not just students and new grads who need the benefit of these internships as people who are changing careers that could be changing drastically maybe going from teaching in an elementary school to to to going into counseling or you know some kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but call'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'manual field or or into accounting or something like that where there's there is like shraddha said there is some ownership on our part to do some vetting and investigation to find out about the specifics of the internship when you know when we're expected to be there the the the the hours we're supposed to work what hour job description is going to be who's gonna be responsible for us who do we answer to you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and we have to do some of our own investigation and those skills like if if internships were illegal and we couldn't do them then we would not start developing practicing those things that we need to implement when we actually get out into the workforce and start looking for you know our viable employment'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'internship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your temporary job position that may lead to full time employment'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think college student often need to work to support themselves and their families when we are in college our family there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well a family want our support and i thought some employee will offer job based on recommendation from previous intern many don't do this at all if internship perform in college days this could be a problem later and may not have the structure we expect'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of it a lot of interns work additional job i mean it it it is it's very tough to find time for for school for family and for the internship but again it's adding value to your skill set and your qualifications making you more attractive to employers so there there is a gain on the behalf of the person who is doing the internship'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'although it is i grieve very challenging to make ends meet and support your family when you're not getting paid so so many people have to work a job where they're getting paid in addition to doing their internship and you know it can be done it can be done it's hard but it can be done'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
