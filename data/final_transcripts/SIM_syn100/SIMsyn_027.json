        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would definitely agree on your points that if we are able to reduce animal suffering and to reduce the killing of animals we should definitely do that but coming back to a point i said before at the moment right now we're not able to recreate a whole functioning human body'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that's why we can't really see how it's gonna affect the human body because of course you can replicate one organ or maybe two organs but you can't see how you how they are gonna affect each other because we got to see our whole body as a big ecosystem and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all of it affects each other and those effects just can't be seen if we do it out of a whole organism'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK i agree but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK there might be some scientific research or there are some which cannot be you know adequately done without animals but at least what laboratories can do is improve the well being of laboratory animals or by you know they can just provide good environment for them rather than just keeping this animals closed into cage and leaving them without painkillers after doing the research so they can just improve their environment at least'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at least what they can do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i think uh just to joel yes i agree with you that we cannot read you know completely replicate the the reactions what the the testing actually brings on a human or even for that sake on the animals itself but i think until and unless somebody doesn't start stepping towards it it's going to be a difficult task to achieve even let's say down the line in hundred years because i i say this because we have already starting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to talk about using artificial intelligence to actually design medicines and you know of course all this information which is required or which needs to be put in for this algorithms to actually design these drugs is already still in a very infant or an ascent phase and all the information until for this is actually coming from the existing animal testing which is currently happening which is acceptable but i think we should also start looking into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all other various possibilities of doing this and i shared that mentioned during during her you know one of the initial statements is that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we have to actually we are giving artificially these diseases to these animals it's not that they get it naturally i think the best example is that last two years we have gone through the whole pandemic and that exactly shows us that how different are we from the animals on which we are taste testing them yes we have a lot of DNA which gets shared from our whole origin but i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the there is a lot of difference between them and us and i see that a lot of money actually gets wasted which doesn't get reported by a lot of companies a lot of the pharmaceutical companies because they don't like to sell that or or mention that you know we spend so much money but yeah we have to throw it down the drain so that would be something which is very interesting in this aspect and until and unless we don't step the alternate path we would always stick to the same path because it's easier'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's available and you can do it and see OK this is the results which we can get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah definitely but when we take a look at the pandemic so it was a whole new thing happening in disease that was as it was then unknown to us and we didn't have a viable solution for it and we had to use a new type of of vaccine and that already was yeah that already was a big risk i would say'",
        "'speaker_1': 'great example'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because it was such a new thing and if we then would have tried it with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things we aren't like we aren't used to if we would have tested it maybe on artificial organs or on maybe some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'other thing not animals we would have more worry tables that we didn't know how they would like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'produce or create what outcome they would create so i think there are some'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'areas where you shouldn't involve more risks than they're already is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and UM uh so elaborating on on joel 's point i i think it's a good point that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh that we can't know how uh'",
        "'speaker_1': 'how a specific human organ is gonna react inside of a whole organism and unless we do the testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh on a full organism and chaitanya has'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh earlier mentioned that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i believe that china you said that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the with a newer technology that it would be possible to test it on humans rather safely but let's say that we're not at this stage and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we would have to test it on a whole organism as joel pointed out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but we don't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they know the risks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'involved so uh shrada and titania on the on the con side do you have any suggestions on how to solve this issue without testing it on animals but having just as good as results'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ohh i think at this point of time we do not have major alternatives to be truthful to you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but i think technology is catching up that's my own personal perspective because i work in one of those or i work with a huge service provider company but looking at the the trends and the clients especially in pharmacy pharmaceutical areas or even going towards the clients who are actually working on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because animal testing is not only for pharmacy so it is all or pharmaceutical drugs it's also for your makeup which we use across the fashion industry and typically fashion industry or they do not actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'"
