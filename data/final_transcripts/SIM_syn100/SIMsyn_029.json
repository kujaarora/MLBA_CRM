        "'speaker_3': 'so since climate change is somewhat cyclical in earth 's history and so the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the thesis here is that our emissions have kind of i don't know accelerated that'",

        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_2': 'however we still need to capture we still need to sequestrate and and and and banker that CO two somewhere and the ground but but that's just an add on it is no excuse for not reducing the individuals CO two footprint'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but but but but but once again class whatever individuals do'",

        "'speaker_4': 'need to do to make this work'",
