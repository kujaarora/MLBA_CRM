        "'speaker_4': 'i need you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because i didn't have any other opportunity and i just wanted some experience on my CV because otherwise no company would give me a interview call and'",

        "'speaker_2': 'OK let's be fat you are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no i would i would disagree again with that because usually what we are speaking about internships that will be either you are just a new new graduate right or you are a student even still or if you are someone who is in a second stage of the life who is reconsidering the career you would have some backup because you have your learnings what you've done so in this case you are not risking that much and that internship is just as a stepping stone to your really big goal so if you look from this perspective'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it is not exploitative it's exploitation when someone is really putting a child to work in a factory or put someone on the conditions which are dangerous to them that is exploitation all when it's someone really enslaving someones flavor but in this you are choosing you have a choice essentially in the western world we have a choice'",

        "'speaker_4': 'doesn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i can't i can't i can't solve for them the issues but at this point but my point is what we westerners have we have a power that when we are we make better choices and we know and look forward how we can help those who struggle the most to bring them out as well and this is a very very big gap and if we speak about in friendships this might be that learning stone what we take here small small cost'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think i i think'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ohh for all these for many jobs people take intention for that and the students who learn mostly are less privilege and couldn't even afford school which is due to abject poverty but one thing is that when the keep learning that one thing the boss try to do is that for a student that they know they can't afford to even learn or the money is not there they tend to always try to get them food and probably tell them you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you can come stay with me but with companies companies in europe where the company that is able to pay and because company takes information about everyone they employ right and they know that this is a less privileged person this is someone who is not capable of even playing for an internship or this is more like the person is just trying to sort out for a job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they left the company is using that person in such a way that it's not an internship and that person doesn't have time to get an extra job to'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well in the in in the US in the US they tried to you know they tried to put a system in place where you know where interns get paid so they're trying to put that in in place so there's no reason that they can't put it in place in europe and to be honest with you most of the most of the bigger larger corporations in the UK for instance do pay their'",
