        "'speaker_3': 'i mean yeah i i that's the thing so like i i study psychology and i was just thinking about this topic and and animal testing and things like that obviously psychology has been bombarded with too many animal experiments and that was what psychology was until the nineteen seventies it was just experiments on pigeons and rats and chimpanzees and all of that to study human behavior and then they extrapolated it but then soon enough they realize that psychology is a science would really not progress unless there is valid data from humans'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because there is only there's only a certain extent like obviously we're not similar right even though chimpanzee share ninety nine percent of our genes and everything where we're definitely not the same on our behaviors are not the same and all of that we live in completely different environments so i do understand that yes animal testing is important in the sense that yes it helps us extrapolate it then to humans but it's also important to realize there's a huge margin of error as well in between so testing on both humans and animals will have to be necessary in order to get any drug out any medicine out any cosmetic out anyway'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i think mostly research i think i think mostly research and i'm just getting getting obviously doing a survey of like the general population asking them what they think and then backing it up with research obviously there's gonna be backlash if for everything even if you say that it's justified if it's not justified there's gonna be backlash for every claim that you make in the world that we live in today but if if if there is a majority even by fifty one percent then forty nine then i think it should it's good enough to proceed with yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'he he will not be able to tell you the amount of pain which he is feeling in his body he may cry he may die but he cannot speak what will happen what is the use of such a testing so this is what an animal goes through they cannot speak even if they die they cannot speak'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is my point'",

        "'speaker_2': 'i mean to say if if we put ourselves in the same position where we cannot speak somebody some alien is testing on humans we are humans are testing on animals some alien comes and picks up a few bunch of people from US some from india some from china and they will take us to their own world and they will start testing on us how how would we feel'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'so we are the best people to test because we need the medicine we need the medication so why not test on us'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well and then and the government needs to know somehow they need to do testing too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like the the government doesn't have like a source of information they they are getting this information through some testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it has to be done'",

        "'speaker_1': 'they they they are not divine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK let's say for example the testing will be done on somebody who is from a political background no politician will come in front and say i give my son and daughter for this testing he will always want someone else to be tested he will not allow a family member to be tested there he becomes very possessive'",

        "'speaker_1': 'OK john'",

        "'speaker_2': 'if if see if it is human who will be benefited then the test should be done on the human if animal is if if the animal will be benefited then do the test on the animal if human has to be if the ultimate beneficiary is a human being then the test must also be done on the human being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no but then do you not realize that it carries a huge risk with itself like what if it's what if it's literally poison so for example there ten volunteers who come in into a drug trial right we give them this vaccine which is poisonous and it and it carries with itself or virus that is that that that literally eradicate the human population which is even worse than covid nineteen they go and spread it out to a thousand other people and the thousand other people go out spread it to a million more people so just think of it like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK OK'",
