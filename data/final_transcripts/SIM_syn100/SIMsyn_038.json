        "'speaker_3': 'you don't have a choice and that's what i'm saying you know the thing is as a as a kid you are you are fulfilling your parents desire they want to have this this child that is is is show is a show for some athlete and and and stuff but but and and that's what we discussed the earlier the way you introduce a child in to sports'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly it's just a parent size mostly'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no matter how apparently you know courses that child'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and also i think when nikki nikita was talking about the ratio that how much or what it should be so i think if you can't you can't come to a decision immediately when you enroll or when your kid starts playing something because at a very very young age let's say OK does joined into maybe two three sports'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'maybe after a few years he excels in one of them so then you can't just say that OK now my kid is doing a pretty good in this swimming or something now i can only concentrate on swimming we can't do that because just to be practical or logical you can't say that every person who is good at a sport at any age of six is becoming i don't know is going and representing the country in olympics right so i think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the success rate in sport is much much lesser than the sexist read in academics because if you're good at academics you can definitely you know grow up get a job make a good living but if you neglect that and concentrate only on sports and you don't make it big so that will be a problem so that's why i say that you give it some time you definitely give it some time see how your kid is doing in your phones but don't connect the education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but that that's actually really good question like'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah the education should not be neglected'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah come compare comparing supposed to academics that's a really good point in a way like i'm actually not very sure that you are correct here because you know many kind of athletes they become in coaches or educators you know they're going this path because they retire young'",
        "'speaker_4': 'set'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if it's you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah but the thing is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like maybe teaching side they go but making it big in the sport they are starting with that is that has a very less ratio i can definitely assure you that so i'm from india and in india get is like it's a religion OK and in every street you will find at least ten kids who are joining i don't know a cricket coaching camp in summer now i don't know but you only have you only see eleven people playing for the country right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there there is something in common here'",
