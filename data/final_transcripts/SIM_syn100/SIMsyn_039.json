        "'speaker_4': 'it's not a good example'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i do you do you really think that he's uh social communication skills are good do you think that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it doesn't it doesn't matter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",

        "'speaker_1': 'no it just an example'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well that is true yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's it's even worse case like the zuckerberg is like even worse like we can we are not talking about normal people like those are the not like those people are not social they were very unsocial and unfriendly when they were in school or blah blah like if you wrote about them in the biography or whatever so it's it's who's examples are not good examples'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh'",

        "'speaker_4': 'no the problem with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not the the problem with that idea that you say that people still can learn that there are those those skills'",

        "'speaker_4': 'uh without going to college but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but i say that the imagine the two people or two two person like one goes to university and one one doesn't go go go goes to job or blah blah they still spent their life apart from the university and job but still they are using their time around the same people almost and the same environments they learn the same skills during those times and the one gets additional skills a lot of skills from the college and university'",

        "'speaker_3': 'your'",
        "'speaker_3': 'let let's say your your your grasp on it is going to be much more focused much more channeled and less broad and i think to put things in better perspective having a broader view is never a bad thing actually very important actually a very crucial part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it it's never a bad thing but it it might not be the best thing at it it might not be the best thing like you have a lot of broader knowledge you have a broader knowledge but what is required easier specific knowledge'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but that that that is correct how however'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in some cases that is true yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because we need specific knowledge it's not broader knowledge is not good all the time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it is not just specific knowledge that's the that's the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no that's the thing that you get confused like it's not only specific knowledge yeah OK let's see i studied like which of fish and stuff like let's say business i study and i learn a lot of things about business but the thing is that i i don't know learn about business but because i studied with the guys who had the back background like a bachelor degree who studied finals who studied like just economics who studied like HR or or whatever and you interact with the different professors from the different fields because like for the HR lecture'",

        "'speaker_2': 'which economic philosophy does your professor subscribe to is he a kenzian'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then which one is required in the in the job market'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you are well well the the the the thing is that economics are not a science they are somewhat of an art and politicians around the world have been able to fuck this one up for the last hundred years and wars have been started over it and yet people still maintain that this is a science when it isn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah the the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is it it is actually i would say like yeah like i i agree partly that it's not master of science but it maybe it's like master of arts but still it's a science like you cannot see that it's a it's a fair deal it is not different to fairy tail'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is very specific'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hmm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but let's go back to the subject of college degree and their own job experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that's why i don't agree with the examples from USA like the for me like it's not good example to show like it's not standard country'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i i agree yeah it might not be good examples but there are examples out there they are examples that our children are are looking at their examples that the whole world is looking at i don't i friend is the good or the bad'",

        "'speaker_2': 'to test our things on them if we are doing it this way if we were to like the this is why i mentioned helping the animals also animals have allergies so if they see if you have a whole animal family and they know that there's one specific house and the people in that house tend to use animals for testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and don't care like they just use the animals and then throw them away left for dead they're not really gonna like that house they might even try to harm those people i can't blame them for it versus if you have a whole family of animals that know of a house that does research for like'",
