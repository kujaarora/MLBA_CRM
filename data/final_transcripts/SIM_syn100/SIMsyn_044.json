        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because when you are forcing a kid then ultimately the fun part is getting lost some somewhere and you know eventually the kid might lose interest in this but and you know they might find excuses to get out of it or something like that so it should never be a force if if a parent is maybe enrolling a kid into something it's definitely because they find it that it will be beneficial in some way so they should also find ways to keep the kid interested in it but also i would like to definitely mention another point that when we talk about sports'",

        "'speaker_4': 'thank you for the difference yeah'",
