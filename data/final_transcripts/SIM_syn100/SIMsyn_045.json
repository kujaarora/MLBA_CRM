        "'speaker_4': 'so if companies start saying that yeah and people let's say a product a company says we have this product and we are testing this on animals for your saft people will reject that product and they say we don't need you we'll go to your competition and when there's an environment of computation other company will use this as an their USB that we don't test our product on animals people will do move to that product that company i've seen that like for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah these days'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a mascara a cosmetic product was you know tested on rabbit eyes and which was you know burning their cornea and other company was providing this mascara this cosmetic product which was totally herbal they were not testing on and though the price of that product the herbal was much higher than the previous product people were moving towards that product so i think the transparency part was will play a very crucial part in that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i agree and also you know the thing that actually related like what you just said see the reason they they feel the need to test it is it has some chemicals right so the you know the the best thing to avoid is avoid unnecessary chemicals if if you can make a product without using chemicals you just do it and you don't have to test it right because if it's not chemical composition it won't harm the human skin or something so you know it all comes down to the same thing'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's more of yeah because people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because people if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if that product is harming at an animal why won't that product harm me as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yes so the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that theory argument is yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so you know if there are no chemicals in your product you wouldn't need you wouldn't have to test it on an animal just to make sure so especially in the cosmetic fields'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
