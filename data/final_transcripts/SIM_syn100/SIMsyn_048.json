        "'speaker_2': 'i i me too i i i just know to too many you know kind of high school teachers'",

        "'speaker_1': 'and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think even before a teacher is employed a teacher should be assessed only on his productivity what he can actually offer this to them not someone who's just gonna give them notes and timings and they don't pass just fill them eight teacher should be someone who can communicate to the student which the student will be able to park their mind to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but but that's the contradiction here because on one side you need a lot of teachers to implement such system that they will be working more individually internship but at the same time like you're trying to raise the kind of bar for them to earn to and to become this the teacher'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or the union or whatever it is and maybe do something about getting these teachers better pay'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at i think then that's the the teachers would be more motivated if they're getting paid what they should you know but right now these teachers are not getting paid the way that they should so if i'm not getting the kind of money that i i i should be getting why would i be having any kind of motivation i mean let's let's keep it real'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'teachers the teachers are very very important in the life of the students because they are like role models outside the parents are the role models inside the teachers are the role models outside and if the teachers are not able to train the students and they're very right way and proper way that suits the current world that we are right now because it is more or less like a technology world now so but teacher is not well equipped even if it's not of sound mind to even teach then the students will be lacking behind'",
