        "'speaker_2': 'of you know if for every hostess that they hire there's also a job in the back of the kitchen that is washing dishes or whatever so i don't think it's it's right to be turned away just basically based on your appearance alone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'defibrillation has has always been and always will be we are just not talking about that you know and we are not discussing it we are not formalizing this you know in policies and everything it's there they're just trying to to to to stop noticing it and pretending like yeah they're all diverse and they're not discriminating but we are discriminating in fact and every stage of our lives'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to to to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'no but but here is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'including personal life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we had a thought so so if if someone is is physically more sort of pleasing from the general society standards there are certain jobs that they are better off and they are of course there are a lot of other jobs that other people can do it someone like me was not so sort of pleasing on the eye i'm i'm sure would it be fine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly using anthony 's point for every job that is customer facing there's also one in the back so if you don't fit the appearance that i want for a customer facing person maybe i will hire you for a job that's in the back that less people are seeing but i'm allowed to discriminate for that first position if i want to because it is what will help my business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'without infringing my sort of freedom'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so but yeah but i i understand why the law is in place too because for you know i think there's certain certain scenarios where you know employers might you know you still have discriminatory discriminatory hiring practices on people based on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there's always going to be some sort of discrimination for example if if i'm an investment bank i don't want to hire someone who adds a low IQ or has low analytical skills where you're gonna draw the line somebody 's gonna say ohh because i didn't go to a certain university or didn't have certain education that's why i didn't get hired yeah exactly that's why you didn't get hired because you didn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i know what you're saying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and and and and and if i'm i'm running a business i want smart people who have good analytical skills who and and if if you went to an ivy league that doesn't necessarily mean that you had better education it just means that they're vetting system is so strong that i can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'presumed that the people who end up there would have something special'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a good point yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so a discrimination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the commitment is unfair recruitment is unfair everywhere to be honest and video even like i university recruitment this is a little bit tricky in that because we are looking for diversity and everything but sometimes we can just recruit students'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's not bad'",
        "'speaker_4': 'complying with that diversity diversity we want to show and that's why we need to to recruit or admit students with the low academic rates for example which we don't want to and those students are not doing quite well this is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but but that's that's that's that's that's not the perfect solution because if if someone is struggling academically the worst thing you can do is put them with the ultra smart people who's gonna just make them feel miserable about themselves because they're competing against the best of the best we should have alternative education systems so we can put those kids there who are not sort of good at cramming stuff so they would have some other sort of career paths so discriminating and sort of having that thing it's not necessarily a bad thing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'combination discrimination overall is a bad thing just society accepted it as a an unspoken through you know so it is there but we don't talk about it you know we are kind of pretending it's not there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now if there's a malice behind it but if if if if it's for it it's for it's for their own good or like just just how things work then i think it's it's alright'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so you're saying there should be exceptions for when there's no malice behind it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah for sure if i if if i if i'm a manager of a football club and someone comes with a positive body image i won't let him in i would say no it's like i'm i'm there to win i i i'm not there to fix a society it's issues or your personal self esteem issues because you you're not fit to play i would rather have someone who's fit and who's gonna sort of run his ass off on the field'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exactly that doesn't mean that i don't think that you couldn't be good for other jobs or that you shouldn't be able to find employment elsewhere or in that we shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then i'm telling you at any less than other person or you should be just not respected as the next person but i'm saying is that you're not fit for this job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you're just not qualified to do the the the work on the field'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah or or anything or or or the type of job that i'm offering i find another person more suitable that doesn't mean that i don't like that individual or a group'"
