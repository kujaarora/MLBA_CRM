        "'speaker_2': 'so as a parent it is our role basically to tell them what sometimes they don't follow rules they don't follow timetables just they just forget and just playing and playing on so i have to remind them now you have to make those changes and sometimes we make a reminder on alexa or google also to remind them they have to now switch off the TV i have a an app in my mobile that's smart plug app and then i can switch off the TV through my mobile app if i'm somewhere out and they are still playing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i think i think i think that's good i think that's good i think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no that's a good i think that's a good idea i mean you gotta have some kind of structure it's the same thing that you know it's the same thing if you know in the workplace you gotta have some type as an adult you'd have to have some kind of structure and some kind of you know so it's always good to be able to you know to plan your day and divide your day up so you're getting a fair share of everything fair share of learning fair share of sport fair share of you know of of everything i mean but again'",
