        "'speaker_1': 'yes exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and you know those i mean these it's not just about their pain and suffering when you there is an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'call it is an aspect of you know moving disease from animal to human so if you know when you're getting into these kind of things which you know don't know so you are playing'",

        "'speaker_1': 'piaya'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct any miss happen happened right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'absolutely absolutely that's what i'm saying that it's not just the feeling part it's a critical analysis part of that as well that it could lead to more danger as well we don't know that right now so it should be it should be curbed that's my point here'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hit it'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i'm sure money is a factor in that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes i absolutely because companies don't think about the sustainable sustainability out of how the phase management can be done and that's a'",

        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think i think the financial aspects actually a pretty big thing i was gonna throw that in there for you guys to talk about because obviously you know testing on rats monkeys is gonna be a lot cheaper than trying to you know fall is more regulations if you get human testing you'll have to pay humans they're the volunteer so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah it sounds like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go ahead'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah that's that's totally true you know you're not paying paying at least for fifty bucks to a human for a simple testing and paying zero buck to a rat it always is economically better to do that yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and so so you know once once we if we want to put in more regulations i mean obviously first you need to talk to the scientists that are doing these but a lot of them are gonna argue hey we need this animal testing are they doing it because they really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do need it or is because there's a financial yeah cause with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they're just being lazy i think yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it depends on what sector it's in you know if it's if it's in the beauty section in the beauty sector of course they you know it's not needed but if it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know psychotropic medications or anything like that it probably is needed i think money is probably a driving factor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah at least at least like the initial phase of testing yeah we can't avoid avoid at least the initial phase of testing on animals before maybe they can test maybe in the second or third stage on the humans but yeah as melinda said we can't avoid in some situations we just can't avoid the animal testing for some you know some specific things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and i think for the the for the vaccine process i think they've gotten that pretty regulated so yes there will be animal testing first and then there'll be the basically the human round i know kind of falling out with covid i know somebody who had volunteered to be one of the first testers i mean they got paid'",
        "'speaker_4': 'see also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'correct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_4': 'plus plus this plus this also one more thing that i have seen going through my MBA right now that when these companies these scientists'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no you know open up that they were testing these products on animals people reject that product in the in the current scenario hence and they find the thin companies open up their mind and try to find ways that which are not exploiting animals so i'm saying it's more about the transparency part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so if companies start saying that yeah and people let's say a product a company says we have this product and we are testing this on animals for your saft people will reject that product and they say we don't need you we'll go to your competition and when there's an environment of computation other company will use this as an their USB that we don't test our product on animals people will do move to that product that company i've seen that like for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah these days'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's that's the hope'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like for example this is this is happening in the these green products for example natural products so people were saying that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a mascara a cosmetic product was you know tested on rabbit eyes and which was you know burning their cornea and other company was providing this mascara this cosmetic product which was totally herbal they were not testing on and though the price of that product the herbal was much higher than the previous product people were moving towards that product so i think the transparency part was will play a very crucial part in that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i agree and also you know the thing that actually related like what you just said see the reason they they feel the need to test it is it has some chemicals right so the you know the the best thing to avoid is avoid unnecessary chemicals if if you can make a product without using chemicals you just do it and you don't have to test it right because if it's not chemical composition it won't harm the human skin or something so you know it all comes down to the same thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i have seen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's more of yeah because people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because people if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if that product is harming at an animal why won't that product harm me as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yes so the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that theory argument is yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so you know if there are no chemicals in your product you wouldn't need you wouldn't have to test it on an animal just to make sure so especially in the cosmetic fields'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's cheaper for them to use the chemicals though is why they do that i think it's it's greed and it's it's making money as what it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes absolutely you don't you don't yeah you don't test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exact'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm exactly they're checking that if we can manufacture this product in a lower cost but people are like i'm talking about the current current scenario like right now in the market if the product is if the product is more expensive but it's not tested on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the animal is not having any chemicals people will go for that product and you know this argument of the companies that we have to test this product because of this chemical goes out of the picture we don't need that chemical we need a product which is out to be natural and that's the selling point so that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my point is like companies when become more transparent about what's happening behind the wheel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh it it's these all those extra you know exploitation of animals testing on animals goes out of the picture because you know see like testing of vaccination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is something which which is i think everyone would agree that obviously a vaccine that you know help us protect from any kind of a disease need to be safe and still people are OK with testing that on a human part of it on a very very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh you know very low dose and seeing the reaction over it people were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK with that so seeing more so you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly because it was necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and it was very transparent as well people knew what is happening behind the picture so that's you know this will pick up companies being more honest and being more honest and transparent will help and us in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hit it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'eradicating this animal quality of testing drugs and cosmetic over'",
        "'speaker_2': 'human testing can go very wrong sometimes though i don't know if you guys are familiar with the tuskegee experiments i believe it was in alabama here in the US but for at least a generation it might have been a few generations they were testing syphilis on african american mostly men'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah yeah yeah i've i've gotten there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and yeah it just ruins their you know it ruined their lives it ruined their families lives it ruin it for generations yeah so human testing can go wrong'",
        "'speaker_4': 'generations yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some economic growth in different areas in some places would have more concentrate concentration of large corporations while others would have more small business so it you you need to tailor the minimum wage to the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i think age plays a factor too because i know as far as the farming community goes like a lot of they might hire like twelve or fourteen year old someone just to get their feet wet with working and their work ethic so they're not working a ton of hours but they're still needing that minimum wage like why does a fourteen year old need to be making that fourteen fifteen dollars an hour and you know i mean most times they're not needing that much money like maybe there should be like a step process of like you know you can work so many hours so this is a'",

        "'speaker_1': 'well OK OK let let me open alternative in this way so you yes you know minimum wage is usually connected to you know trying to keep poor people closer to the living wage but do you think the universal basic income should be involved in that and kind of that it should not be the burden on the businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to keep everyone not poor but you know should government be involved maybe not in the minimum wage but providing money directly in universal basic income version'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i mean you can't expect businesses to you know take up the entire burden because then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like they mean like for example if in a if in US it's a minimum wage is in someone 's on moms of dollars and they can see that in underdeveloped countries you can get the same amount of work done in with lesser cost we would you know'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah they will go there they will move there you know production facilities somewhere you know'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the cheaper labor'",

        "'speaker_1': 'basic income yeah uh-huh'",

        "'speaker_4': 'how does universal basic income and with minimum'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well the the idea is that for example the there are different versions of doing that but usually government provides like every citizen is getting the certain amount of money no matter of what just just because of being citizen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean that would what is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like you're getting i don't know a thousand dollars a month that let's say just for being an american citizen and that the idea the main idea there that it is the universal so everybody gets it and that kind of supposed to keep them closer to their living wage that even if you don't do like you know the the great job very well paid job it it gives you enough money to survive so you are using it as an opportunity to either pursue other career'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or maybe to i don't know walk in a place that cannot pay you that much or trying to be your kind of you know businessman and try do do that things'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but would that motivate people to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so instead of the instead of the employee the government pays you'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i mean thousand dollars'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well well moneys not the only reason why people work'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah that'",
