        "'speaker_4': 'like they mean like for example if in a if in US it's a minimum wage is in someone 's on moms of dollars and they can see that in underdeveloped countries you can get the same amount of work done in with lesser cost we would you know'",

        "'speaker_1': 'like you're getting i don't know a thousand dollars a month that let's say just for being an american citizen and that the idea the main idea there that it is the universal so everybody gets it and that kind of supposed to keep them closer to their living wage that even if you don't do like you know the the great job very well paid job it it gives you enough money to survive so you are using it as an opportunity to either pursue other career'",
