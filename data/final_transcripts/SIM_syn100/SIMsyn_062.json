        "'speaker_3': 'but then yeah so then if you're even looking though like from the perspective of the employer like say you have two say you have two very viable candidates and they both have the same amount of experience but now you have one with a degree and one without a degree you're gonna go with the one they have the same amount of experience you're going to go most likely nine times out of ten you're gonna go with the person that also has the degree that kind of goes with the experience now the other the other thing could be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well but but these people they also they will question you they will ask more money'",

        "'speaker_4': 'but but you know that that that thing you call disagreement i believe that's what you you need you know like if if employees open to challenge because that's another advantage of high degree because you have people who can challenge your decision who can you know ask questions who can think outside the box'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and and and that that's what i'm saying like if if that's the kind of a person you are looking for then you want someone with high degree and something else that they've been one that is nowadays not one that in but probably expected it'",

        "'speaker_2': 'we are doing tech work so they can employ someone they can they can employ a mechanical engineer with a very good software developer into the position of a software developer as long as you are good with it they they just want to see your work like i said at first the most companies want to see what you can do what you have done before that is what they wants now that is the tech companies those are what happened with tech companies google tech companies any tech company that's what that's that's what that's what they do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ohh yeah yes yes the technique that you can show'",

        "'speaker_2': 'whether you have experience you need a little bit of education'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because most companies now we notice something is most companies when they want when they want to employ people they employ people with experience with greater experience first with education then they're not employ a lot of people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who are just educated don't have experience then those ones they put them on their intention so they start learning from those that are experienced so by the time the company grooms them for a long time the company pays them low after the internship and the company sees that this ones these are ones the good the company filters them and takes employees that are good not ones that are good now starts with the basic salary which means the company is always gaining'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they they taught them and they're using them as manpower so for someone who is not educated and has a little bit of experience it is at a disadvantage for them because at that kind of a job offer most of them will struggle to get in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's frustrating though is that oftentimes then with the if you have like that degree you're you're seeing a lot now that those higher education degrees are becoming more and more obsolete like you were saying david that it really does kind of look more towards that experience like with that software development with the computer technical skills and even like if you look at some people that go into photography or like the performing arts even like categories and it's like OK so you're getting a degree in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah and but but you know nowadays also the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know art or photography when that degree is not going to do as much as like that experience that work experience that you're really gonna learn hands on and so like you were saying it's really just depends on the industry right like i you know it really just depends on that industry'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well like for example the the liberal arts or arts in general degree the the idea there would be that this degree will give you the accessibility that you don't do we know one type of art you can always switch to a different way you can kind of it gives you broader understanding of how art works'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and flexibility but also nowadays you know we we also uh equating experience and had degrees so what i've seen mostly is like ten years of experience is equal to a bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i don't know if it needs fifteen years of experience to be equal to masters or twenty to be equal to PH D'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'admitted to PH D'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but what i have seen is ten years of experience is equivalent to a bachelor degree looks like look to me it looks like over valuing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh that's interesting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the higher degree because ten years of experience is a lot especially like in careers like engineering and computer science that's a lot of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like yes to compare to adjust the bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there are a lot of you know certificates that you need to get the standards you need to learn'",
        "'speaker_2': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah for for for certain kind of engineering but for example computer engineering you don't need certificates and and stuff but ten years of experience in computer engineering that's a lot compared to compare with the person that is coming out of college with a bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to'",

        "'speaker_2': 'well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no yeah it's it's not like that is very unfair comparison but in in job description like in hiring like the job description i've seen that if you have either ten years of experience or a bachelor degree and i was like wow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_4': 'they cannot get into the job'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can't get into the job so they have the disadvantage now but at if that kind of a graduate does can use the internship it did in school in varsity and the experience they use university they use it to qualify him and like OK let's check you out let's compare you let's where you with this person then interview will be conducted for them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right interviews with people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh yeah i think but but those are what the employers that are doing probably i'll say that also they're still doing wrong with like people with higher degree'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they get when it comes to pay they get paid more and and that's what we like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'send a message that had degree is important but if even if we experience and high degree like the higher degree people get paid more even compared to people with experience and probably that's what he's sending message at the at some in some industry it it makes it like high degree is important because of the pay but you know not the productivity and and maybe the titles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah you need to pay them all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but the pace is usually a lot more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's also a good point'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but should it be more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'she should be well you or degree more than an experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i would say no because if you you compare like let's take the comparison of ten years experience and and the bachelor degree'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it for me to be fair the the person who is ten years of experience probably to be paid more than a person with bachelor degree but i have seen people with bachelor degrees getting paid more than people with ten years experience'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they shouldn't be getting paid the same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh i think pizza'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and then simply because they have the that bachelor degree ohh maybe masters'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think someone with the degree should be paying more than'",
