        "'speaker_3': 'well it it kind of depends on like where you're going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like i did i did a i did a tour through africa like three years ago and before before i went i needed to get i think seven or eight vaccinations done in in a couple of months so like if you i mean that's huge benefits to it for example if you go to africa where there's still like a lot of infectious diseases are really prevalent'",

        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like my grandmother'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm when the UK we have been we have babies and young children that are getting illnesses that we've not seen in the UK for many years because a lot of parents are deciding to not get their children vaccinated'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep but again'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then that's tough that's very tough getting your children vaccinated versus not getting them vaccinated it's a big step what's stops most parents probably is the fact of knowing that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'oh wow but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you if you already know that knowing is half the battle and acknowledging is it means you're halfway there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'm at the point where you are about to let a doctor inject a virus into your child 's really have to think about it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because if they're gonna catch it naturally they're gonna have their natural form if they catch it after they have that vaccine you can bet your bottom dollar dollar it's gonna be bad'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and science backs of the doctors'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it comes back to trust again doesn't it you have to trust i mean yeah this is obviously to my opinion you have to trust what the medical profession saying and if they advised that these vaccinations are going to help your child not just your child but the community that they live in as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's the point so many people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'then yeah and that's the same as the coronavirus isn't it was always about protecting the community the elderly the vulnerable'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so i'm my oldest leaves me being compromise'",

        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then again for companies like the moderator rightly said for companies where these are not you know there are some companies that might that might feel that ohh we want a specific or a particular look for employees we want them to be from maybe this race you know we want them to have long hairs we that and all this superficial looks has nothing to do with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the character the the the qualifications of some of these people applying to them or the people who are intending to work with them so i would rightly say that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this shouldn't be considered you know it shouldn't be considered and in areas where they need to be considered there is always a place or a room for many people or a room for everybody'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i agree to it like for as as you are said that how about office job i would say like sometimes a good looking people are considered more trustable but if they are also considered like there's a thing called like like good looking girl sometimes they are conceited less intelligent also this is like biased which exist i would say and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as i mentioned earlier like in tech jobs and all so there is also bias based on appearances like if they if if someone is good looking people concede ohh OK that person just got a job based on the looks not on the intelligence what this person have or a communication skills or overall personality that's also a bias due to appearances which are sometimes considered where the intelligence is more needed than a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the bimbo'",

        "'speaker_1': 'it's nice to have some nice eye candy there at the counter the stair at while you're waiting these hours and hours and hours so i could see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that being a case'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so i could see them pulling their best looking person that scaled the and i didn't take to work'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more attractive'",

        "'speaker_4': 'up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i would choose a person in a airline industry who has a better smile than who has looked good looking if a person because i think overall this smile makes a person if they're approachable or a friendly or not like if there's a person very good looking person but just not smiling and just having a straight face and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not uh that person will not be friendly and appealing to me'",
