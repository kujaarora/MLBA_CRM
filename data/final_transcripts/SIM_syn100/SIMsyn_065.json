        "'speaker_4': 'so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if i'",

        "'speaker_1': 'they you know they're not developing their flexibility and and things like that does it mean that we still kind of force them to you know do active sports or like the more physical one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you should'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again you shouldn't really you should you shouldn't really force them but you should then again tell them the importance of of you know if it's for health tell them the importance of doing some type of sport let them try swimming let them try there's many you know let them try just walk in you know competitive walking or not competitive walking but you know long distance walking or getting in your steps as they you know people people like to do so there's plenty of things that you could do to keep up the physical'",

        "'speaker_4': 'no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they want to play it's their own decision i think we can't force them for anything'",
