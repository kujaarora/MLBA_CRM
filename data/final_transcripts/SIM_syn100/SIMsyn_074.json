        "'speaker_3': 'no you know you know i was i was saying that you know the the closer the animal is to human the more they get used for experiments you know i mean closer in terms of the like the logical like the biology like the way they are the genes and and also the health problems that they get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'had a really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and and this one yeah that's why the mice uh'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'very what like they used to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot more than others because of that like the the similarities with humans so probably probably the guinea pig is the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah because i think it's like my supposedly this year like about ninety eight percent of you know genetics with humans so that so they're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with you in mind'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so yeah that's why the one yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and the monkeys too'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah i know the monkeys are really close it's even even more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but i guess a lot of it too goes into the trust like you know we we take the word for it again from the scientists that OK this animal testing was the reason we got this done but should there be i guess more questioning could you have gotten this breakthrough another way or with you know less harmful testing on the animal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know the other thing i was thinking is that we use animals for testing that you know medicines and like mostly industrial medicine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but my thinking was if we we we learn more towards traditional like using naturally natural medicine like for example trees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah herb herb herbal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like this you know the the natural things and we can use those to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to create medicines to create cosmetics then we don't have to test because we know if if i'm using'",
        "'speaker_3': 'spinach spinach is not harmful for humans so i can even use human to test my spinach medicine'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but everything does not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but maybe from from the herbs you cannot make i'm i mean you cannot cure all the diseases most probably that's why the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and i i think i'm haven't explored enough'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yes but most of the heart'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's because they were trying and testing on themselves that's why we we we go to to use those so probably research was supposed to go toward that direction focus more into natural things that they can even if you tell to be tested with winter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i think that's that's when the economics come in it's definitely tougher to sell cause like we can go to the grocery store and get ginger for cheap and if if if you find out it's just that's some all natural things you can just go get then they can't sell you fifty dollars a pill'",
        "'speaker_3': 'eggs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah it's because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yes yes yes this is for business reasons because if you tell me this medicine is made of ginger and spinach'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i can i can make my own'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes exactly'",

        "'speaker_1': 'there's also a lot of college research happening that are are grants are users that are using animals so i mean there's still money involved with that and if you have if you have a grant from the government to keep doing this testing then are you going to admit OK this testing is really not that effective we want to do it or you just gonna keep taking the money and getting paid to do your research'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ohh for sure they're gonna keep taking the money'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for sure the the the money of course'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i think we're all in agreement that yeah like cosmetics things that aren't i guess medical related or potential like breakthroughs for helping humans that the that those are not and and do those and that's not some i didn't look up did those does that happen much anymore i know it's a big thing obviously the man i don't know much about the makeups and all that so it is that i know there's their branding like animal cruelty free and all that so is that is there still testing on animals for cosmetics'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like absolutely necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think that i i believe there is a company that released the the abandoned complete they completely abandoned'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm making cosmetics like like testing their cosmetics on animals'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i believe they they give a statement i i will search and and and send to you in a chat quickly but i remember i saw that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but but but you know from from the end you know everyone is finding a niche you know like if they stop doing the animal testing what everyone else is doing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's also it's it's a business uh so it's a business opportunity or it it gives them a name and like it's a brand so so they use they used it more of like a brand not not a commitment because they are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they just use the opportunity because the animal activists they have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on them like why are you using animals just for cosmetics and so they took that opportunity you know to make a brand out of it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and then you think oh that's a nice company'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh yeah in some of those companies they might test on animals for half of their stuff and not on the other half and they're doing a marketing campaign talking about these products are not animal testing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when i was reading'",
        "'speaker_2': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they have they have'",
