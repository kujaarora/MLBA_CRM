        "'speaker_3': 'i think in a service'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah discrimination is bad it's a but i think so let's say when you are speaking about the pending service stuff they usually you need to have certain characteristics like you said smile before because it's important it's welcoming people but amazon as well i would say you do one extent when the drivers are coming up right they it's much more nice than they are smiling because they are representing the organization this is where their appearance come in organizations are end of the day they are making the money so they need them stuff they need to create the face'",
