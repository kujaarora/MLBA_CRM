        "'speaker_3': 'the i mean there there is one of the the difficulties that has to be addressed but i don't think that that's an argument for making unpaid internships illegal because then that counts out all of the people who possibly do have the support of family do have a part time job may work on campus to help pay off some of the bills i mean you make a very valid point it is is the reality that there are people who are you know lower income the only time they have is for school and for their part time job'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so if companies start saying that yeah and people let's say a product a company says we have this product and we are testing this on animals for your saft people will reject that product and they say we don't need you we'll go to your competition and when there's an environment of computation other company will use this as an their USB that we don't test our product on animals people will do move to that product that company i've seen that like for example'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah these days'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah that's that's the hope'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah like for example this is this is happening in the these green products for example natural products so people were saying that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh a mascara a cosmetic product was you know tested on rabbit eyes and which was you know burning their cornea and other company was providing this mascara this cosmetic product which was totally herbal they were not testing on and though the price of that product the herbal was much higher than the previous product people were moving towards that product so i think the transparency part was will play a very crucial part in that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah i agree and also you know the thing that actually related like what you just said see the reason they they feel the need to test it is it has some chemicals right so the you know the the best thing to avoid is avoid unnecessary chemicals if if you can make a product without using chemicals you just do it and you don't have to test it right because if it's not chemical composition it won't harm the human skin or something so you know it all comes down to the same thing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right i have seen'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'essential and you know just convenience so we need to you know people need to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know kind of bike or these kind of products and maybe they'll make an effort yeah it has to come from the people some part of it definitely has to come from the society yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah it's more of yeah because people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah because people if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if that product is harming at an animal why won't that product harm me as well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly yes so the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that theory argument is yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly so you know if there are no chemicals in your product you wouldn't need you wouldn't have to test it on an animal just to make sure so especially in the cosmetic fields'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think it's cheaper for them to use the chemicals though is why they do that i think it's it's greed and it's it's making money as what it is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes yes absolutely you don't you don't yeah you don't test'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah exact'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hmm exactly they're checking that if we can manufacture this product in a lower cost but people are like i'm talking about the current current scenario like right now in the market if the product is if the product is more expensive but it's not tested on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the animal is not having any chemicals people will go for that product and you know this argument of the companies that we have to test this product because of this chemical goes out of the picture we don't need that chemical we need a product which is out to be natural and that's the selling point so that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'my point is like companies when become more transparent about what's happening behind the wheel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh it it's these all those extra you know exploitation of animals testing on animals goes out of the picture because you know see like testing of vaccination'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is something which which is i think everyone would agree that obviously a vaccine that you know help us protect from any kind of a disease need to be safe and still people are OK with testing that on a human part of it on a very very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uh you know very low dose and seeing the reaction over it people were'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OK with that so seeing more so you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exactly because it was necessary yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly and it was very transparent as well people knew what is happening behind the picture so that's you know this will pick up companies being more honest and being more honest and transparent will help and us in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hit it'",
