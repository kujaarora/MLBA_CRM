        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'individual departments within schools i think there's some room there for that to be used as an analytical marker for you know the teachers and the school district at large but maybe not so much as you know on the students i don't know how representative standardized tests are of of students ability classroom'",

        "'speaker_3': 'it could be classed and it could be racist and it could be it could be worded in a way that is easier for others to some to understand than others so i'm kind of like i'm on the fence in that if they're gonna use it to test the curriculum then i'm cool with it if they're gonna if they're gonna hold back students because of it and and use that against them in any way or form then i'm against that so that's where i'm at'",

        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i watched my kids go through it and they are fortunate that they test well but i remember it being a very large part of her week at that point in time it was a week and you know get to bed early no extra curriculars there were T shirts that they had to wear they'd have pep rallies it was a big lead up which put a lot of unspoken support but also i think pressure on elementary age students'",

        "'speaker_2': 'i do think it is good to check in on students progress again you know just recalling working in a a junior high and there were students that clearly were struggling to maintain grade level they've just been you know promoted they they age progress them when they you know hit a certain age like at the junior high once kids hit sixteen they promoted them to the high school regardless because you really don't need you know it's not it's not fair for anyone to have them but they you know'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_1': 'testing there was like i don't even know what they learned in school all year but they were being taught towards the test so why couldn't you know a programmably implemented or part of the curriculum just regular test taking skills rather than this weird like'",

        "'speaker_1': 'uh being forced to fill out bubbles and stuff like that and then it's boring it's not you know and here's the other thing if you're told that hey this group of kids succeeds at this test and this group of kids doesn't succeed at this test there's that bias that will affect testing you know what i mean so it's like it it's it's it's a difficult thing because many college students probably didn't do that great on any standardized test that's one thing people the times have changed information is'",

        "'speaker_3': 'i think there's actually books i there are books for that i don't think there's a there might be even classes for it but not as part of any like any kind of school or anything but i i do know for a fact they're definitely our books for that'",
