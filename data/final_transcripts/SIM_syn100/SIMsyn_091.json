        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because that would cross the line into discrimination then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right but then there's obviously right there's obviously that line so you can say you have to look attractive but you obviously can't really become much more specific with that because as soon as you go into let's say young skinny white whatever the beauty standard is that people look for exactly that would go into discrimination and i know that a few years ago abercrombie and fitch had had a big lawsuit about that they were hiring the all american image or whatever they called it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's discrimination'",

        "'speaker_2': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah and and i mean race is technically a fairness in appearance it might be a company only once yeah person that's as of a certain skin tone so obviously that would go against discrimination i think that's that's where you definitely need to draw a line but some of the other things you mentioned like i don't think i mean i'm sure there can be lawsuits but if if they said and obviously like places like hooters are not hiring obese waitresses'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'i would never find it hard to argue against that because that is their business model and any other position like i'd say abercrombie and fitch where it's supposed to be just a a a staff a a retail worker and it's kind of hard to say that an obese person wouldn't be able to work there and also considering that obesity is considered a disability'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at least in the united states and does seems like you wouldn't be able to discriminate against that'",

        "'speaker_1': 'this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there there should be nothing that should be holding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'uh somebody who is plus sized to get employed remember a few years ago uh it how everybody reacted when plus size model started working on these all these high end fashion shows and everybody was all years about how inclusive it is it can be a very powerful marketing tool if you know what your clientele is if you are in an area where'",

        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",

        "'speaker_3': 'you know gets more butts in the seats and then then yeah the golfer it it could be a marketing tool as well just like i really doubt all these people who were promoting plus size models in in in the berlin fashion shows and et cetera and so on and so forth were actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about the cause versus getting cheap marketing'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the the thing about that is i don't think they would hire anybody that's not fit today at at a company like that cause they they're more about their image and especially now with social media i mean i think that's a factor as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oh yeah image cells'",

        "'speaker_4': 'of course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if they're not interacting with the customers and the business model is not based on looks like strippers for instance that's based on lugs but if you're an accountant in the back that shouldn't be based on looks i mean you're not you're there to do an intellectual job not a service job that has to do with looks and if you're only in tiring attractive people for like back office jobs i would be concerned that there was an element of you know maybe sexual harassment going on in that area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean i yeah'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ohh that's obviously'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's probably OK because it's that it's skills for the job not not just for every role and not for every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hmm'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's a great way to say it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well what one of the examples given here is airlines so obviously the flight attendants stewardess whatever you want to call them i think they do tend to want to get better looking individuals and that i think also i mean there's maybe there's a there's something there too about you don't want somebody that is too obese because you're on a plane they're gonna be going down the aisles and squeezing by people but you think that is still fine and'",
