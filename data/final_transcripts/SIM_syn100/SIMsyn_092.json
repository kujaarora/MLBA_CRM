        "'speaker_4': 'he'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well i i'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so if you know that this is important to you to to have this forum and and to have everything out there and open then you know that you're taking the risk of of any potential employer seeing that and not liking it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'i would just rather have an open forum to where people can feel comfortable and and have someone to come to you about those things versus having open caskets of these people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i get i get that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but if an employer has a problem with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they were able to see it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you know we we can't keep we we can't make our our profiles open and say anybody can look at them except an employer you know there's no way to make them not look at it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the funny thing is we have kind of like the different problem here we have the we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they're actually is that's the thing umm there is a place on there where you go into and it says anyone could look at except that's where employers are supposed to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a page for their company they're not supposed to be sending hey can they're not supposed to be saying things like they know that like you have a main page for your company if an employer if the employee decides to have the employee not see it should be very easy to go in and just put the employers page on except like do not let this page see it but then you have employers that are gonna try to bring other employees and and say hey go look at that page because i'm not allowed to and that's where they come up with things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'making it illegal because it's wrong'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there's one you can do to combat that realistically like how are you gonna get around that people just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like cream'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OK so not not all employers not all companies do have a company page and we have to remember that behind every company is people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'accountability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's great'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well if they are so tied down on being able to hold people accountable for what their social media page is maybe they should get one for their company'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but they don't have to i mean that's it there's there's never been anything saying that a company has to have one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ohh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this can be very catastrophic in a bad way but yeah sure'",

        "'speaker_3': 'as in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for instance one time i thought i got some backlash on there and and like i said i'm a content creator on there so i'm i have to be accountable for things i put on there facebook itself won't let me put things on there it finds an appropriate so i don't wanna hear that from an employer i can't if i put something that facebook finds unappropriate on there and i mean the the least inappropriate i'm gonna tell you the story about it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it it's the same'",

        "'speaker_1': 'and they faulted me for that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well you know you're human you also should be allowed to to make a mistake sometimes you're not you don't need you can't think about everything you're doing all the time so i think that's a problem not just with social media but with the internet in general that everybody expects you to be to be completely perfect and they just judge every single thing of you and that's that's just something that's just wrong with it to be honest on ethical point of view'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and i didn't understand it because the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'yeah'",

        "'speaker_1': 'a person reports you they review it and then they contact you mind you like i said if anybody sees my family they're gonna see at least one dark skinned parent of mine at least one so on so that would explain to me why this post was sent to me at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it can happen by being reported but it can also it can also happen just because'",

        "'speaker_4': 'so white'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yes but once you send in your your reply they do put you in line with the regular person'",
