        "'speaker_1': 'you know if we got to make sure people know what their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know know what they're doing know what they're telling you and not just telling you stuff because they think it's right it has to be right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah to be fair like this i i do agree with like yeah a medical doctor like degrees and things but i think these these days just decrease for everything because there are those many people going into higher education and like everyone thinks it's it's the only possible route after after high school which is which is a huge problem so now there's like degrees for like the most random things on earth and i i don't understand like you mentioned customer service which is which is just bizarre like these jobs existed back then and people were doing OK without getting those degrees we're just experience or like they find their way into it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but now there's just a degree for everything basically'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and then there i think the specific ad that i was thinking of the job was they wanted you to have a a four year business degree like what do i need a business degree to talk to customers on the phone who are upset that just makes no sense and i can't tell you how many of my friends have art degrees who are then going i can't do anything with this or english degrees which you get out of school you have an english degree all they do is expect you to teach and you're like well i don't wanna teach you're like why did you get a degree in english'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'mm-hmm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well it also wasn't agree a degree in teaching english you know there's a difference there too because english could help you be ohh i don't know a proofreader or you know believe it or not there are those you know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and like you know somebody like for magazines or something like that's considered english yes that could be considered writing classes but english in general you have to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know do you guys get what i'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like that that's people just try to single it out to one job it's like ohh heck no cause teaching'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'depending on the type of teaching you gotta have you know even a bigger one depending on the field and that's one thing too'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah and myself i have a degree in applied mathematics and i have literally never used it i don't know why i got that degree i don't know why it's been four years doing that but i have been bartending most of my life so i always make a joke i'm a bartender with a math degree and literally haven't done anything with it didn't really think through what this degree was gonna pan out for i guess in the long run thought maybe i wanted to teach didn't wanna teach down the degree is kind of useless'",
        "'speaker_1': 'right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well you didn't number outside you didn't keep track of the numbers of you know drinks that everybody was having you know single it out that's about the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah exactly i'm i'm pretty good at giving exact change though'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well hey that's mathematics'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because you know if you don't give the right amount back or if you give two of uh much back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so there you go you you technically did use it i mean it's not applied man you know like but it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's kind of that little bit like you know we don't think about it but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but yeah i just had to throw that in there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think it does develop our thinking to some extent though like like that's the whole argument like for teaching like subjects like science and math until like high school like it develops your brain to think a certain way like it uses some analytical thinking some critical thinking skills that wouldn't have otherwise been developed hadn't students been taught math and science for example so like so like just just teaching the brain to work that way and like push itself'",
        "'speaker_4': 'developing that thinking i believe the soft soft skills that we learn from the degrees are are what we take back and take into the working world more than like obviously the theories and everything that's completely useless yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah like the ones that have been around for or that have been not contradicted but you know just kinda changed so much it's like well then what's the point of learning some of the things i mean if we wanna see how they've evolved that's one thing but how much of those are we going to use'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i i'm very interested in in in a in a kind of an aspect question on this and since there's you know two went two women and two men and the conversation something that i knew in my recent applying for jobs and just reading over there's various articles and things i had found out that women are less likely to apply for jobs that they don't meet those requirements say if there's an education requirement women are far less likely to apply for those jobs than men which i find very interesting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'i'm wondering if you know either of either the men in the conversation kind of have a perspective on that as to you know would you apply for a job that you seem to be less likely prepared for or don't match that job description of education because i know i just straight up won't if it says you need this education i just won't apply for it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's me a lot of times i'll admit it i especially with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now ones that i'm definitely not wasting anybody 's time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh is ones where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if it's in another state and it's hybrid'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then i can't do it like you know because i can't drive and therefore i'm not gonna know if it's you know fully remote that's one thing but you know that's what kind of even if it's not degree requirements if it's even something as simple as not driving'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you know but yeah i i a lot of times because i think it not scares you but it's like ohh well it might even gonna be accepted like i mean sometimes if it says the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for a furred then i might apply'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i just feel like if it's says you know requirements you know a degree in this field i just go well i mean i know it's just a couple clicks but i'm not even gonna waste my time but it was just interesting because i read an article about how men are more likely to apply for certain jobs even if they don't meet the requirements'",
        "'speaker_1': 'but preferred'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well people also gotta understand men aren't indestructible either nobody's indestructible and so you know but what's up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i think'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_3': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if you're good at something and then that's it you're experiencing this particular field i want to apply for a job and they say you require a degree well for me since i'm experiencing it also apply either way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the objects difference i know the working principles everything i still apply whether i have a degree on it or not i still have life and i'll putting those experiences like if they give me they ask for water and what can i do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i'll put this in i put it in for them'"
