        "'speaker_2': 'yeah i would agree with that totally'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is it well like like what what you can do is make humans lazy OK like right now'",

        "'speaker_3': 'ninety percent of the company have employed chat'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that's OK one of the thoughts that you they can't replace a person with a chat bot OK they're replacing the whole customer service department with the chat bot OK so this is there OK but it has a very high cost of creation OK so losing jobs is common with AI as AI advances there will be a ton of jobs which AI can replace OK but what you need to do is prepare them beforehand you have to have an excel which can't be replaced by an AI OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the government should increase that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and i think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'i think that's our big concern is that there isn't these steps aren't being taken ahead of time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's AI is here now people are losing their jobs now they're not how are they gonna get trained in something else completely different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they've already lost let's say they've already lost their jobs so then now what they have no money they need schooling to to have the skills to perform a different job'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but the thing is that the thing is that you can't you can't ban AI OK like what government can do in case what what is the alternate solution like you can't you can't remove like you can regulate that but you can't just high technical technological advancement OK if you hide that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'no no way should be banned we're should be regulated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah nobody saying that though nobody saying we should hinder the advancement of technology we're saying that it should be used for good and that it should be regulated'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because as it stands now a lot of things are not regulated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the thing is that in AI the yeah is a very small pocket of information which we have today OK like i can work in my home on artificial intelligence OK like i can train the eyes from my home so regulation part is very difficult for someone OK like if someone is doing a regulation it has it is very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they can't regulate over that which is in every once home OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so that's that's difficult OK what you can do is that you can train people to adopt the AI and you can move with the use of that you can create a ton of new job on the basis of this you can have the university design here alternate courses OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for that there should be principles to use artificial then you can have some principles which everyone can use or something like that OK'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but what about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'another area'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pretty out there like you said factory jobs so let's say you have a factory job so obviously'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you might not have a higher level of education so then now what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK now the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well and on the education side i even worry about children today there's no need for them to retain knowledge if all they have to do is turn and ask a computer what the answer is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'i mean they don't even know how to speak to basically the sponsor'",
        "'speaker_3': 'doctors that is a very good point like one of the amazing points i worked today OK amazing point OK but nowadays there is one thing like we used to remember things very easily OK nowadays children are following things very now and then OK like my mother used to find everything which was gift in home at the fingertips OK i'm not able to do that OK that's my children's are much worse OK so it is there so there is this thing OK like they think that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yes so then if that's true right so then you're saying also the more that AI takes over the stupider we are as this as a society because we're doing less so we're not just lazier we're doing less i think humans are capable a lot of things i don't think that machines need to take over everything'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is this one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is that's bound to see'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK there is an oscar winning movie of payday pixel OK like i didn't remember his name where there was an a robot and the whole humanity was on E I O K and what they did they just became fat and got to the outside of the environment OK so it was bad which i predicted there and it is bound to happen like see no one uses their hands to wash towards anymore because they all have washing machines'",
        "'speaker_3': 'no one you generally people don't use to wash it until they are dishwasher that OK so this is bound to happen OK like things are bound to replace today OK previously there were like a ton of washers available everywhere OK their main job is to wash codes for people OK but right now everyone has washing machine OK so this is bound to happen'",
        "'speaker_2': 'but my washing machine my washing machine can't potentially injure or harm somebody'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this is one aspect OK which the AI has not yet reached OK it is i think it is never going to reach that level OK like within our lifetimes OK so that it can do that OK but there's there will be some guidelines the USA as one of the pinnacles of technical advancement they have a great team there they will have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah but would you say there's a lot of different ways of hurting people like let's say you're using a celebrity you're using AI to to you know to fake that they're there are some celebrity doesn't that hurt them it can hurt their career'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it pinch it can hurt their career and their livelihood'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you don't get it it is still OK this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OK like the thing is that but you can't control that you can just you can have some other technology which can tell that whether this is fake or whether this is genuine OK you can develop that OK there is the counter for technologies and other technology OK it is not that you can't turn the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whole thing down OK you can have a different technology which can tell that whether it is genuine whether it is doctored OK that you can have always OK'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so it is there OK but there is a very high cost to that OK so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is nothing like free range OK so yeah it runs at a very high spot parts OK they have to have a ton of machines they have to have a expertise OK so like people are sitting at their home is not going to make doctored videos OK if someone has invested a ton only then they can do that OK and they can trace it back also if you have good'",
        "'speaker_3': 'systems at their please OK'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're using it now though in ways that are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'plus'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there is also one thing OK AI can like this is my personal opinion that it can never imitate a human OK like devices are sensible but they don't have feelings or ethics OK plus we have evaluation of hundred thousand years OK they are just right now being bought OK the humans have been evolving since last i think i don't know how many many years we are in this planet OK so they can't just come here and be our master OK we will be masters always so'",
