        "'speaker_4': 'umm so again it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so how do you balance that the you know the competitive spirit and the idea that not everyone should win'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well it's very you know it's very difficult but you have to explain that there's always you know winners and losers'",

        "'speaker_3': 'yeah i think reframing it is more about like dealing with hardship and like not that you're a loser but loss and to go back to the video game esport part of it i think that there are now i mean there are now like teams that you can compete on and while i think that people look down on video games as like a sedentary activity and it's like rotting brains and encouraging violence like that still is a huge market'",

        "'speaker_2': 'the children aggressive maybe few games are bad for them but at the same time they develop their reflexes also so i think completely hindering them to just saying no to the game i think it's not a good idea because in today's age i think everyone every child is so fond of if games if we do that so that makes our child against our feelings or our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that what we say to them they will not then listen to us because they discuss these things with their friends in the school and they discuss what games they there's friends play at home so if we talk about if we told them do not play anything just go and play outside i don't think so they really like it i think balance has to be there parent has to keep an eye on them which game they are playing and we have to just make sure that there has to be a particular time so they can enjoy their space also and along with that they place'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_2': 'codes as well so i think for me both are really equal if we keep an eye on which kind of games they are playing so yeah i think games are also a really important part to develop their reflexes yes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you know you know saying saying that balance is good but funnily enough in society these days how many children do you see go out and play sport like they used to when i was a child we would be out on the football field playing you know playing playing every single sport when it came round to super bowl time we'd be paying them even though in the UK we've been playing american football when it came round to wimbledon we be playing tennis and so you know but these days how many children do you know if i looked out and there's a field outside'",
        "'speaker_1': 'umm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you wouldn't see children out playing like that these days most of the children either play sports at school or they or they you know they join the club they don't go out and play with friends like we used to or like society did twenty years ago so i mean and not all games you know again sitting on a computer game playing computer games'",
        "'speaker_1': 'uh-huh'",

        "'speaker_3': 'obviously yeah for sure i agree with that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'yeah i saw him'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OK well i i mean we talked a lot about the balance but actually isn't that the whole point of this discussion is like where is this balance is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that you know the yeah i mean everybody would agree that we they need to have some physical activity you need to have some competitiveness some you know team playing some maybe education and everything how do we balance that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of course we have to tell them like they have a particular time for them as i as i uh just discuss that i had a i have made a proper timetable for my children once they come back from the school and they have a particular time for their TV time games time and then studying and for their play time outside in the garden and sometimes they also help me in house chores so yeah we have to make a proper timetable if you leave the children along with game they will not realize how much they are playing they will just keep on playing'",

        "'speaker_3': 'so since climate change is somewhat cyclical in earth 's history and so the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the the thesis here is that our emissions have kind of i don't know accelerated that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'ohh that that that that that may well be true but now look at the reality class the german population represents one point two five percent of the global population so it's miniscule meanwhile we have large swath of people in china and in developing countries in africa that do wanna eat more meat and keep eating more meat every year'",
        "'speaker_2': 'customer demand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correct and and because there are more than ten times more they're more than ten times more people in china than in germany but on the on the other hand the chinese have still a much lower income per head if we don't go ahead and show that it can be done differently we can't expect from the billion people in china that they are going to eat less meat we we have to do it first they're on the lower income that yeah they're progressing'",

        "'speaker_1': 'i think that you have a point regarding the the impact of the bigger companies yeah i i agree that there are there's a huge amount of responsibility on the major players in this game obviously there is but that does not negate the significance of the individual and the reduction of a person 's carbon footprint on the game as well that's my position'",
